mazda3 i-stop : a spirit of sport sustainable
mazda to prove that a sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment .
for this purpose , it comes to include on the mazda3 and arrest the system of initiating the driver , called i-stop , an arrangement that , at least for now , is available only on the gasoline engine 2.0 150 horses .
this second generation of mazda3 be illustrated by the right note that it has achieved in its entirety .
details , the finish of the vehicle , the habitabilité , behaviour , the mechanics , the system i-stop ...
all these aspects is remarkable on the new mazda3 .
starting with the post of conduct , it is true that the seats fronts are a ergonomie one hand and excellent .
the touch of the wheel is also very pleasant .
by continuing with the whole formed by both the picture of control and the equipment , we see how mazda has pursued in japan 's trend to create an internal futuristic design , with many buttons and orders , as well as vivid colors red and blue .
this style reminds us of , in part , one of the honda civic .
therefore we can say that both the mazda3 that the civic , both japanese , contrast with moderation of german products , especially with the volkswagen golf , which all want to surpass .
in with the compact , the japanese car shop has a habitabilité more than sufficient to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort .
comes on top of all that a great trunk to regular forms .
and arrest the system of automatic start to the engine , at least for now , is available only on the gasoline engine , of two litres and 150 horses and change manual of six speeds .
this engine is a true happiness . it can be illustrated by the delicacy , his low noise , its benefits and the control of its consumption .
indeed , although the most requested mazda3 are diesel models , those who do not carry out a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-stop with engine speed petrol , both for his great comfort for consumption controlled .
concerning the equipment , the chosen for the test model is the sport , in other words that has the largest number of " elements of series .
among the series , the assistant to change of road - equipment rvm that removes one death , the speed of traction and stability control , the regulator , the mirror internal photosensible , a computer on board on a large screen size , the independent sensors parking , air conditioning , the capteur of rain and light , the bluetooth and audio , as well as the wheels of the bluetooth alignment of 17 inches , are particularly noteworthy .
moreover , as if this equipment is not enough , this had version of the pack premium for 1,500 euros more , include elements of the adaptive headlights bi-xénon audio system and bose with charger records .
round-up
the mazda3 2.0 i-stop has been one of the best car compactes of its class .
it illustrates in particular with the quality of the materials used , for his behaviour and his high level equipment .
moreover , those who do not carry out many miles per year will be able to choose the i-stop linked only to the gasoline engine version 2.0 of 150 horses .
the only drawback of that model is its high price , that lies between 21 770 euros for the finishing luxury and 23 270 euros for the tested , the sports model .
in return for the large sum , the mazda3 every day we will offer a large degree of satisfaction .

's promise of fonpeek
peek is extremely limited , it is a system which allows only to watch his electronic mail , without giving the opportunity if only to see certain type of coins attached or surf the internet .
it profita his five minutes of glory in the united states , when time magazine désigna as one of the products of this year .
in truth , it is more difficult to see him in the street , but the idea sounds interesting , especially for the young people .
unlike smart phones , peek offers a very low price and a monthly subscription , less than half of what , for example , the subscription costs data of the iphone .
given his success , the company has launched two new devices : one designed exclusively for twitter and the other with a free service of data for life , for six times more expensive than the peek .
fonpeek , presented yesterday during the event the web , has the european version of the invention and its third incarnation .
it is so limited that his american grand-frère , but it leaves a surprise .
the price for its monthly subscription , about 12 euros , includes the roaming throughout europe .
those who travel with a smartphone already know what represents the abandonment to the data when you cross the border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the wifi - or a connection to fon - to be able to check his mail .
the idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive , and for a long time that she should operate .
indeed , some operators have special arrangements and options journey , but as far as i am concerned , i would need to be made a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small print .
repeated calls to order of the european commission to propose roaming fees affordable in the whole of europe has had a barely perceptible effect .
outside their country of origin , it is reluctant to use the data , and we have not wrong .
that a small plane as fonpeek - it is always curious he is called fon so that it does not possess the wifi - offers this type of tariffs , means that operators are beginning to think differently and study various proposals to increase their network of data .
kindle is another example , it includes downloading of books and other research on the internet .
without subscription , and without together .
it is a device connected , and it pays in his purchase and not every month .
and that is what i hope to see one day for the fonpeek : an option to purchase with access to life as peek proposes already in the united states .
non that i want to to buy it .
i look my mail on my phones , thank you .
i hope simply because i believe that it is a more fair formula for the consumer .
it would be interesting to see how a computer with this same system .
's favourite colour of michelle
the yellow , without a doubt , the favourite colour of the united states ' first lady .
if it went to the assumption of office of barack obama to the presidency of the united states with a habit ' and a coat of this color , it has , in fact , chose the same to accompany him in the second stage , without doubt , the most important of his life in oslo : the award of the nobel peace prize .
michelle obama was a very similar in both occasions : besides colour ressemblante model , a yellow shooting towards the green with reflections bright , both times , the holding consisted of three parts : the habit ' , the jacket and , at the same tissues , and coats ornée of great broderie or a string .
so that a first glance , it would seem that the first lady of the united states monitors the aftermath of princess of asturias and chose to put the same held .
but the fabric for carved up the two blocs makes them very diverse .
if the assumption of office , he was a dentelle thick , on the other hand , it was in oslo a velvet printed .
the accessories are different : the shoes green to heel means for the first golden opportunity , and a similar pattern , but , this time .
hairdressing too has changed : hair has now raised while it was abandoned the previous times .
75 % of the professional working mothers have had problems as a result of motherhood
discrimination at work has increased in recent years , especially for women in the younger generations who want to be mothers .
reveals that the study " fertility and women 's professional career in spain , " carried out by the csic together with the instituto de mujer .
the survey , conducted on 9 737 women 15 to 75 , leaves no room for doubt : 75 % of working mothers have seen their careers limited as a result of motherhood .
the study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life in a partnership and the number of children , whether or not the woman works and the kinds of jobs occupied .
those who do not have any activity outside the home , work part time , or have a stable work little , have come earlier in a partnership , and have more children have their first pregnancy earlier .
instead , women who have a stable job , mostly in the public sector , reject the entry in life in a partnership and the first pregnancy , and have fewer children .
women aged between 35 and 49 to have a fixed work have their first child , on average , 3.7 years after having built in couple . that figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector . " these data indicate that women who have a stable job requiring more time in their lives for that , which led them to reject the union and the arrival of the children .
more broadly , the type of job exercised influence the maternity leave , but less starting date of cohabitation , " explains the chercheuse the csic margarita delgado .
the level of education is another factor that widening the gap with the age of marriage women and their first child .
according to the survey , the greater the level of training is high , the more they have marient and have their first child late .
the difference is also maintains among the women of the same generation .
for example , in the group having between 35 and 49 years , those who have made studies elementary and higher were respectively mothers for the first time to 25,1 and 32,1 years on average .
' to another disctinction also appears among the women , according to their level of education .
while those who have done basic studies marient and have their first child had to find a stable job , those studies of higher average level or reverse this programme and give priority to the achievement of a stable work as a condition for marriage and the arrival of a child , " precise mrs delgado .

be cowardly attack
last week , my mother , who has about 70 years , will promenait fuenlabrada in our district of the city , when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years spent in addition to it and our dog , a sang-mélé , rescued in the spa and weighing no more than six kilos , and without saying a word , they assenèrent two birds of feet who grew the dog seriously injured .
outrage is huge because we do not see what it is free amusing to attack on a small animal defenceless which , in addition , was on a leash .
this is in addition to the indignation of a woman who is promenait quietly and , when it came injuria these individuals to fear for physical integrity as a énergumène attacking an animal is capable of doing the same thing to a woman , a child , a ' or , ultimately , anyone lower than him .
the episode held at around 5 p.m. , like any other tuesday , in an area normally calm .
pavlov 's dog has gémi throughout the day .
of course , we have filed complaints to the station headquarters even if we doubt that it used to much , and not to touch the sensitivities , we just want to clarify that the cowardly murderers were spanish .
indignation has led to denounce this .
we do not understand what is happening to young people so that they are fun to mistreat free an animal defenceless which gives us the love , friendship and keeps us company .
we do not know where 's the good education , and the respect for animals and persons .
michelin and fesvial , sets for the port of the helmet
the tyre manufacturer michelin , in collaboration with the spanish foundation for road safety , fesvial , has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet , mainly among the motorcyclists youngsters , as was indicated today the two bodies .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of the port 's helmet , since it is the only element of protection to avoid head injuries , or even death , in an accident on two wheels .
michelin said that the campaign was in keeping with his commitment to road safety , which goes beyond the design and manufacture of products increasingly safe " and said that it helped to this goal by other actions in educational and informative .
this new campaign for encouraging the wearing of the helmet in two wheels , under the motto " to be but not to be , " a first stage in which include posters will be delivered in more than 500 garages effect , in order to ensure the more widely available .

sales of light commercial vehicles is progressing
after nearly two years ago , the market of light commercial vehicles is beginning to see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel .
the 9 425 vehicles registered in november in spain is an increase of 12.6 % compared to 2008 and , what is more important , they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to the figures of the patronal manufacturers association anfac and ganvam , the dealers .
however , we need to alter the good news , because the reference for the comparison , the month of november 2008 , has been particularly bad , with a reduction of 60 % compared to the previous year .
accordingly , despite the events of the last month , the immatriculations accumulated during the 11 months are below 40 % of those of the previous year .
since january , if we add all vehicles coming into the category of light commercial vehicles - derived from cars , vans , pick-up fourgons light and lorries to windows light - 95 853 have been sold .
large clouds that affect their request did not disappear . indeed , even though they are bought by individuals , most purchases are made by small and medium enterprises , who pay in nearly 100 % of the cases thanks to an external funding .
and , in addition to the restrictions involved by restricting credit , we need to add other factors such as the rise in the unemployment rate and the continuation of the bad economic situation .
faced with this situation , and unlike the cars , the aid to the purchase of the 2000e have little served .
in addition to individuals , the independent , and those who wish to acquire a commercial vehicle slightly less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of co2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre , can also benefit from it , but the number of operations speaks for itself .
yesterday , in ganvam , it recalled once again the need for the government to pay special attention to these vehicles and also the industrial vehicles , trucks and buses .
the dealers ' association provides a year 2010 similar to that which ends , for which it calculates a fall in sales - private cars and the suv of 19 % .
aid the emergency brake is now mandatory
as has occurred with the system anti-lock restrictions abs and it will take place with the stability control esp , the aid the emergency brake systems will become compulsory element on the european cars .
mandatory they are already on the newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles , whereas for the rest of the vehicle a period of has been set up at the end of february 2011 .
the measure , imposed by the european union , is intended to reinforce the protection of pedestrians , even if , through its mode of action , it can also help prevent many shocks back .
the attending the emergency brake is increasing pressure on the brakes in urgent cases detected by the system through the shot in the foot given by the driver .
but it will not always maintains the pressure until the end .
according to a study conducted by the manufacturer of car components bosch , one third of the drivers involved in accidents did not rely on the brakes before the collision , and half of them had not benefited from its full force .
until 1 hundred accidents
intervention of aid , in revancha , requires the maximum the braking system , cutting the distance that the car needs to stop .
according to a study by the eu , if all cars were equipped with that sort of elements , up to 1 100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be prevented each year .
this reduction would be even more important with the popularisation of said smart emergency braking systems : it is a sinister in four with the injured would be avoided .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system that , thanks to a radar or a camera , detect obstacles slightly and warns the driver , in addition to act on the brakes .
if the driver reacts , it applied by increasing the pressure on the aid , if that is necessary .
if it does not react , and although the collision is inevitable , the mechanism is the maximum effort on the brakes in order to minimize the damage .
general motors expanded until january the opel plan for
while the workers of the opel plant in figueruelas - zaragoza - were warned by nick reilly , the new president of general motors - gm europe , that the production of the new meriva would be launched in the first week of april - probably the 8 - according to javier ortega , the north american manufacturer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the opel rescue plan .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , mean that every point of the plan has been approved in advance by the parties involved .
and this could mean that the final document , which will first be subject to workers and the governments of the countries where plants , be postponed until early 2010 .
among gm , by contrast , we assure that a decision on the sale of saab should take place within the next few days .
so it is no surprise that the swedish government has tightened up the pressure on us manufacturer in order to take a decision as soon as possible .
gm agrees come into contact with of possible new buyers .
one of them could also be geely , which aspires to acquire volvo , but the candidacy of dutch manufacturer of sports cars skyper , supported by the russian converg group , is increasing in importance .
if there is agreement with none of them , gm could sell a part of saab to the chinese company baic .
close saab 's decision by the end of the year whether it is not sold holds .
driving from the porsche boxster spyder
to develop their last and valuable gem porsche , engineers went to the boxster s and have succeeded in the amincir that nothing less than 80 kilograms , leaving the balance to just 1 275 kilos .
this led to happen in the first place , the automatic roof which has been replaced by a roof bâché manuel , to reduce 21 kilograms , using doors in aluminium like those of the gt3 , other 15 kilos less , to remove the climatiseur , 13 kilograms , reduce the 64 to 54 litres of petrol tank , 7 kilograms of earned , to engage in bacquets sport , yet 12 kilos , and light with tyres 19 inches , five kilos .
finally , they gave up the audio system cdr-30 , earning six other kilograms and replaced the poignéesdes gates by handfuls of tissues , saving the remaining kilogram .
although the model also exists with the pdk box to double embrayage , the test was carried out on a model to manual box of secondary six speeds , mainly on the roads of the network of california , in the mountains , with particularly tortuous however .
his behaviour can only be described as beyond reproach .
reducing weight does not mean the car to drive in the soil , with aplomb .
on the contrary , it was a long time since we had not tested , a model as small and light which , at the same time , guarantees as secure in the however , including at high speed .
it is a small athlete , capable of échauffer its musclesà small speed for as long as necessary , until we requested him to sprinter , once again to curb , to recover and to push its engine ...
it is out what we wanted . thanks to his leadership , as forthcoming as precise , the car will do what show our hands on the steering wheel .
and they will do so with surgical precision .
its driving force at will
the sound of her constantly boxing v6 , with 320 horses - 10 more than the boxster - was particularly successful and can be strengthened with the option " sport " or through a system that is changing the rugissement the engine , already used on the panamera .
the ability of acceleration is brutal , whether with the ruling or hopping .
suspensions are standing firm , but not hard or uncomfortable .
road routes that we have travelled with the boyxster spyder was blighted enough , but the car has managed the nests of chicken .
electronic assistants were barely here on the whole journey , whereas in certain however we have found the ice in the early morning and the graviers , later in the morning .
ultimately , a car ultralégère , one of the most divertissantes to drive and which is much more than a simple change to the boxster s.
the car will be up for sale in february 2010 , to a price of 70 831 euros .

brazil sets a date for the beginning of zelaya
the brazilian government has set a deadline for a stay of manuel zelaya in its embassy of tegucigalpa .
the deposed president should abandon the légation diplomatic on 27 january 2010 at the latest , an official date for the end of his term of office .
francisco catunda , in charge of affairs of the brazilian embassy in the capital of honduras , has confirmed in tv globo that " mel " knows that he must leave the embassy , where it is refugee since september 21 , before that date .
" he knows that he has to leave on 27 january , at the end of his term of office , it must seek another destination . "

after elections on 29 november - during which porfirio lobo was elected , zelaya gave assurances that it would remain in the brazilian embassy until january .

-lrb- hu -rrb- thank you very much
after days rose since the spring , when asset inflation was the dominant note on the markets , the uncertainty arises again , this is not surprising because it is a matter of their natural state , in an area where the agents to take decisions on an uncertain future in nature .
the remedy used by central banks to stabilise the markets has been to monetize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and , indirectly , by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero , so that the purchase of assets to mobilise financial institutions .
central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchase of assets have almost been finalised , and without undermining their political maverick liquidity , are starting to put a bit of sand in the machinery , such as the ecb , with their contracts to a year of next week .
consequently , investors have doubts about the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery heterodox without measures and we are witnessing an inverse of the reduction of risk premiums .
volatility scholarships and different business obligations increase again , although they remain far removed from paranormaux levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year .
states have been forced to private socialising the risk and public debt in is threatened once again .
there is again a flight to quality and the united states , japan and germany have been refuges chosen by the investors , provocative greater differences between the countries in the euro zone and germany .
spain has been barely affected by this incident of instability , but then standard & poor its threatened with a new downward revision of the qualification of the kingdom of spain .
on the other hand , some uncertainty is not a bad moral risk , which advocates to silence tried again to create a case of awareness among lesresponsables of global economic policy which had hampered the destructive effects resulting from the credit limit on the destruction of the jobs , although what we should do is declare a new day of action of pardons .
however , the situation of dubai resembles a fight between tribal sheiks to restore its place at the power in the emirates , and we have already seen the case in greece .
a government which hides a deficit , elections and a new government that discovered the pot in roses .
prodi did in italy , after berlusconi and socrates in portugal after durão barroso and
it is quite irrational ecofin rescues hungary to a lack of respect for its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro country not to respect its commitments .
what makes sense , however , is that the ecofin incited the greek government for transparency and makes its citizens are partly responsible for the need of extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as expected , we are faced with an episode of normalisation of risk premium transitional , after some excesses in positions , that would be predictable .
in the case of spain , as long as our differences in the public debt has risen to the measure of the obligations of european companies , nousn' need to worry us .
if differences and that the europeans were us continued to increase , then we would be a risk idiosyncrasique spanish .
the standard & poor 's case is an anecdote . when our forecast indicators oblige most studies services to anticipate their models of recovery and to revise upward their forecasts for 2011 , together with the oecd and the european commission , which are on the offensive with a japanese model pourl spanish economy , it adds little hope for their warning .
once again , this has all the spanish seem to be an excellent opportunity to buy assets , although for the moment " caution is the mother safety . "
sectors message
the president of iberdrola , ignacio sanchez galán , yesterday , was the first to speak before the subcommittee of the congress of deputies , which is discussed in recent days the spain 's energy strategy for the next two decades .

iberdola , however , consider that for the next decade , the investment must not be devoted to increasing the production capacity , but the distribution networks and to international connections .
from 2020 , the matter is changing , and it will increase the strength .
his bet focuses on both gas and coal plants , with mechanisms to recovery of carbon dioxide and , above all , on renewable energies .
in this area , it considers that 18 , 000 megawatts more are needed , together with other " energies of support . "
galán sustainable economy , who believes that the draft law that the government has just approved is in line with the calls for his company , did not want to tackle the royal decree aimed at encouraging the use of coal , which contradicts the national policies to combat global warming .
according to him , there is a clear challenge to the long term " in this regard , despite the measures " specific , " as the president has qualified for iberdrola .
however , galán believe that investment decisions , although they are in the long term , will start to be taken , because they put some time to achieve their maturity and that a lucrative stable framework is needed to address them .

the catalan club , current , taking the title and final winner of the old european cup in 1992 , is fifth on the list .
at the top of list are the manchester united and bayern munich , the two teams who have charged , in addition , the more money for their participation to the last champions league .

and the champion wins , 9 million compared to 5.2 received from the other final .
and , under the fixed payments , a club gain at least 7.1 million , and a maximum 31,2 million .
on the other hand , the barça was pocketed 2.5 million on winning the super european cup in august .
but there are variables , payments that are enshrined 337,8 million .
this money is distributed on the basis of the proportional value of each market television .
the spanish market is the one of the most significant , and have four seats attitrées .
the champion of the last year making 40 % of the money allocated , 30 % in the second , 20 % for the third and 10 % in the fourth .
the other party will be made according to the number of matches played over the " edition of the current year .
