i : - sir lydia dunn support motion of thorough and thanks to your because . policy and government 来年 of land plan wide clearly 
for this information of the members address wealth giving new debate . 一度 of the year legislative council &quot; hong first cross country &apos; 展 opportunity to 身手 and effective of tai receive . future government plan tested 
as we have already announced , study , unofficial five members to all part of various groups , area are : the groups have study select 
government structure * , and of the future of operation * economic and financial ; ; and matters civil servants 
* social plan ; 
basic * development ; facilities 
* law , order and security . 
i will other members speak will speak today on government . 22 members speak in these groups declaration , economic and financial structure , joint security ; 23 members , officers with matters and public in order and infrastructure . and social plan speak tomorrow 
we hope , . this 轮流 concentrate in when speak of approach . old 随意 &quot; shall , &quot; speak our will be targets 10 分钟 about an improvement on 
we , we are this can be no limit on speeches of each , i must therefore clear that the interest speak of does not mean selectivity to other the subjects they subjects identified . we will certainly not again night speak ten others . 
i sir , in your address welcome your emphasis on the government first wish thanking you for maintain and prosperity for of practical programmes hong determination stability . implement different stages 
the participation of the leaders of both countries 英两 , joint declaration clearly through the wording in countries , have two 衷 signing 诚 hope countries at continued prosperity and stability hong can a . 
two observe the joint declaration strong as ever . 
since , in the joint declaration after china affairs hong conducted set initialling , in china more people also hong kong has become presence under more 明显 keep role . 
neither is this sinister . 
joint declaration . relationship will certainly more than ago enable close both parties 
these joint is important , desirable declaration to achieve . first make 
we , but future development our future cannot concern should have to the present has actual than and because . 
we have a future . if we cannot resolve not present 
i therefore in this session suggest members three . work concern areas first 
legislative affairs . first concerns council handled 
六八年 . standing orders this in a council nine have alteration 
now we need to think thereafter . amendment be longer 
六十 组合 of and legislative members today with different , council character use of the standing orders in practice we need to review tai the 繁复 , council enable . much before than 
we therefore committee , to review and should suggest amendment standing orders established . 
furthermore , accountability , we have to for more necessary public more 取 阅 document have established expected 盘问 or witness and , abode special 聆 committee held openly . non- openly call 
legislative unofficial members , as council manpower increase office enforced secretarial will require the . offices 
i think is the economy . next should priority 
this , in the main 主义 must continue . protect export fight markets 
our prosperity development , and our trade our access to markets trade depends on required relying on . 
if our economic development , no market thriving economy cannot ; no thriving prosperity . we cannot maintain stability 
export market , our years of goods strengthen . exports to cope with steadily 
we , each products and 克服 赖 difficulties changing can once 转换 . market whole 
颇有 , our has appears fact that achievements 日益 the this 加剧 . being

agreement to our bilateral our limit accept pressure 日益 . instead of less strengthen 
the government , in overseas offices people is provided each successive blow to react to impression that for . able to do will 
士 , but they have these offices day-to-day there are competent people in to affairs ; obviously manpower and meet sufficient been kept so busy 先发制人 attacks . to protect 主义 meet 
i ask our overseas strategy therefore : what is ? 
whether just to react ? 
if we 影响力 , surely we must anticipate events to develop to react . , and not only succeed 
in review multi-fibre arrangement negotiations next year , for negotiations difficult fresh , we comes prepared what required before ? ground 
this is very 意向 , of market affected seem to the task of kong millions 搞 , to tai non- seem activities hand . public relations 
but this is not so . 
number of people make major decision an opportunity is quite small . 
we 过来 targets and those people does not they is millions needs to seek . 
this must political , social and economic , of market clearly main efforts knowledge stepping-up ensure , export market development , convince background recognising and respecting persons policy-making can enable to rights gatt in our international . merits 
in this , but it is have recently strengthen start late u.s. efforts year ago we 客 , even in only a say no u.s. also to expect three , what shortly where great impact . 
in international gatt of our , , long term status should standing in the battle for understanding if this is settled as soon as possible 巩固 . beyond much would 
although in this , as joint declaration annex guaranteed in has a joint sir , this . inform this group still under discussion council 
a beginning . discussion of the group , only 
, whatever discussion , after &apos;clock sino-british the gatt are required they are receive on admit . passed formal 
i hope this very soon . 彻底 important matter can resolve

we all know , these matters , we 看到 but we need to be complex considerable 杜 绝不 , people of activities . rules have as a dedicated to do its utmost to discharge

in fact , encouragement office employers provided for some time in with and . that both enforced from employment 
if political rights 划分 employers and community will no political rights for 贱 &apos; employees 民 &quot; well-to-do would cause unrest . 
i hope this government should consider similar to those in the employment ordinance . exception just to prevent 迫害 measures recurrence . 反 
if this is , then this pattern kong kong &quot; down my spine . &quot; issue matters people ruling

we should unemployment figures . 日益 上升 of keep 
government and three employers employees , to enable hong always can labour problems and resolve with respect , i recommend that government should , good employers 出力 workers and i.e. contribute . services , of workers to alleviate provide hardship 
then , and 室外 悬 long white section offices offices in policemen levels listed rescue the negotiators side will become thing of the past .

i support the motion , sir , with these remarks . 
sir kam-chuen : - , since cheung , our september 1984 initialling declaration joint 明显 场 and securities of owners signs there is real estate . upturn in 
this confidence resumption also to welcome actual hong . indicated that future under and repeatedly

. important the next few years will be very very 
political and economic . 抉择 we all in regardless on performance 
i two important prepared to this problem when early 一来 , but this over the views will address my of minutes . certainly 10 
i . 遵照 to only one time speak problem intention . welcome members will believe in this mean 
we , and develop a most politically must seek implementation of the joint declaration framework enacted applies to can . by step towards 
because easy framework this work is not transitional in this , must 1997 time achieve a smooth can to our future stability and prosperity , the arrangements provide a meaningful base for fostering also . 
we must , to achieve these , understanding and from all sides patience purpose sincere co-operation receive . 
the international 外交 should 一贯 formula in probably negotiations undue on , and trust that 今 of very is no exception despite unfortunately hong times on the other side and china common objectives british declaration , they are appears to hong kong openly and repeatedly high . the level of mistrust still both parties 
china attitude any recommendations by british seems to be . this is all suspected than caution , but a with , would such caution if undue it cannot be denied also , only proper and objective analysis of issues impede of serious problems not necessary more , rather than solved . to cause deferred 
, attitude and other british seems to have taken a china mistrust . 费力 how to remove no also initially 
in , but when 诚意 proposals might some both parties 挫折 , talks 遇 good seems . of lacking a for hong kong all seek a satisfactory solution dynamism 
蹈 误 of thinking that the other side will never understand very &quot; easily a efforts . 没有用 also again therefore &quot; 
in the next few years if not positive adjustments to this both parties 思想 . , the common objective smoothly reached certainly way cannot 
i urge , understanding and , therefore in consideration for our anxieties , and when discussions carefully both parties with sympathy and maintain public confidence , and pragmatically close . solutions can to manifestly foster 
the people of , on how to , we have to admit and whatever face private feelings , a wish special powers government next fact since 源 is china . central government will administrative region 
possible future changes in china , are the deep concern majority of our persons directly system . china will accept election and not whether 
we , and we 失落 存 明朗 because of not have china will change significantly present course of policies and not feel that afraid that directly elected . our future legislature whether main 
, and we must not one thing is actually any illusions over it . very clear special independent of autonomy , nor is not administrative region by government 普选 freedom of action by system equivalent to within . democratic produce 
government , special 从事 must next time and consideration caution administrative region interests walk . central government of china interests meets 
i think , behaviour 愚蠢 accept this fact is decline . is 
indeed , we achieve prosperity and stability , in this kind of autonomous environment if aspirations . economic development is to maintain this must 长于 赚钱 because we are for money is always whilst our top priority , be other , , reached desirable . to step by step should pursued 
i recently , certain groups of people have taken from undue detected ( attitude in 1987 an opportunity legislature haste long ago , present structure review ) new form of government . community a compulsory 
and , of basic law 情绪 高涨 this committee directly elected representatives of relevant advisory proposed formation and . attitude , be undue requests haste 
and that , of say , cannot be stopped democratisation hong process that someone , a totally or in 1997 directly elected legislature must established least previous . 50 per cent 
even , directly elected democratic special proposed that someone , is the only government framework administrative region desirable adverse effects and pressure withstand 节制 china may do produce can . 
direct elections , support in further some people think the recent even promote directly 替代 . election election should form 
i , sir , in your permission 不如 to direct i some of and declaration openly like 深恶痛绝 . election that 
i attitude . on this matter open 
i experience of political , would even , i 主张 our future constitutional framework our society growth hope the process of direct , and have elections . territory-wide form once too sex 
i 坚信 unique situation , we , on the meanwhile study direct elections as part of attitude , pragmatic and should merits or demerits stable and prosperous comprehensive avowed common objective realistic , in take account analysis 理想化 情绪 倾向 and also 化 . avoid 
i think , any firm , in addition should make review indirect election policy-making constitutional development of first 理论 starting our foundation to . to 
we must , 才干 足 consider the system purpose members can be breed . of returning carrying 
election , we should consider indirect if solve these problems and to improve on the system in a . can 
fair , indirect election system without giving reasons , 到底 before it a real measured what is ? 
i 信仰 , not see any pragmatic reason why desirable except , to hong is seen 急 . 待 不及 direct election of land established that merits 
finally , we in direct elections sir future necessary if conclusions , we still face fact that some pilot conducted and will not become an independent hong kong is not necessary sovereign state . 
we experience of political and development in circumstances always . existence economic do 
our formula for success . , 剧烈 过急 changes will not present land prematurely
