we don &apos;t want to do this . &quot;

daschle urges president bush to provide hard evidence to show hussein violating rules
( afp report from washington d.c. , january 28 ) senate democrats &apos; leader daschle expressed his objection to president bush &apos;s evidence to show that iraq owns weapons of mass destruction , suspecting that the white house had a set of &quot; guiding principles &quot; to justify its attack on hussein .
daschle asked : &quot; if we &apos;ve got evidence that iraq has nuclear and biological weapons , why not show it to the world ? just like 40 years ago when president kennedy had photos showing cuba had missiles and ordered the ambassador to the un stevenson to show them at the un assembly . &quot;
daschle harshly attacked president bush in a speech to the national journalist club in washington when un arms inspectors presented their reports to the un security council on whether or not iraq had abided by the disarmament requirements .
&quot; when we begin to launch a war against terrorism , people in the united states have the right to know why thousands of us troops will be sent to the battlefields to risk their lives . the united states will spend billions of dollars while at the cost of offending the alliance to enrage the opponents to attack iraq , &quot; he said .
&quot; in a democratic country , the president should do his best to clear up people &apos;s doubts and this is very important , &quot; said daschle .
he referred to the american people &apos;s declining support for president bush in a public opinion poll .
the white house , in turn , justifies the urgency to overthrow hussein with various kinds of excuses , including threats to neighbors , persecution of the kurds , attempting to kill president bush , linking to the 9.11 attacks , making weapons of mass destruction , which confuse people who don &apos;t know which one they should believe .
&quot; it makes people to suspect that the government has already had the supreme guiding principles , &quot; he said .

you never expect to own everything from the very beginning . you expect to take a while to be part of nba but things have been different .

bush vows to disarm iraq by all means
( afp report from washington d.c. , february 14 ) us president bush vowed today to disarm iraqi president hussein &apos;s regime by &quot; all means &quot; .
he made the accusation by saying : &quot; hussein has weapons of mass destruction and has used them ; hussein is used to deceiving the world and continues doing so .

this was bush &apos;s first response to today &apos;s un security council meeting in new york .

research finds father &apos;s gene may affect timing of child &apos;s birth
( afp report from paris , february 28 ) according to a denmark research report published on saturday &apos;s british medical weekly , father &apos;s gene may affect the timing of a child &apos;s birth .
about 5 % pregnant women may have prolonged pregnancy , or to say the pregnancy reaches 294 days .
it is now known that the problem will have negative effects on the health of the pregnant women and their children . however , what is the real reason is still unknown .
researchers in denmark followed 43,000 birth cases from 1980 to 1992 . all the surveyed pregnant women had at least two children and had prolonged pregnancy when they gave the first birth .
analysis were only based on their previous two-birth information .
in general , among the women who had prolonged pregnancy when giving first birth , nearly 20 % had the same experience when they were pregnant for the second time .
however , when the first and second child &apos;s father was not the same person , the rate declined to slightly over 15 % .
major writher of the research report ellison told afp : &quot; this is already very high .
this shows that if you have the same partner ( when giving birth to the second child ) then the possibility for you to have a longer pregnancy is 30 % higher than those who have changed their partners . &quot;
the research report says : &quot; if women change their partners for pregnancy , they can reduce the danger of repeated prolonged pregnancy .
we think that this is a new discovery .
and this means that the timing of the birth may be decided by the father &apos;s gene . &quot;
