we do not want this . &quot;

daschle : the president should present proof on hussein &apos;s violation of international law
( afp , washington , jan 28 ) democratic senate leader tom daschle challenged president bush to present proof that iraq has weapons of mass destruction and doubted whether the white house has a &quot; guided principle &quot; to justify the war against saddam hussein .
daschle asked , &quot; if we have proof that iraq has nuclear and biological weapons , why don &apos;t we show it to the world ? just as president kennedy sent adlai stevenson the then us ambassador to the un to show us photographs of offensive missiles in cuba to the general assembly 40 years ago ? &quot;
daschle vehemently criticized president bush when addressing the national journalists &apos; club in washington , while the un weapons &apos; inspection personnel is reporting on whether iraq abided the arms reduction order .
he said , &quot; at the time when we just begin to fight the war on terror , the us citizens are entitled to be aware of why thousands of us men and women should be sent to battle fields regardless of risks of their lives , why our country should spend billions of dollars , risk to offend our allies and inflame our adversaries to attack iraq . &quot;
daschle said , &quot; in democratic countries , the president should try his best to answer people &apos;s questions and remove people &apos;s doubts , which is essential . &quot;
what he refers is that surveys show that dwindling support to president bush of the us people every day .
the white house give various rotating reasons for the pressing need to overthrow saddam hussein , including threatening neighboring country , torturing kurds and attempting to assassinate former president bush , alleged involvement in september 11 attack , manufacturing weapons of mass destruction , etc . these makes people wonder which is the real one . &quot;
he said , &quot; it makes people doubt the bush administration has its highest guiding principle . &quot;

russian expert : space shuttle disaster may lead to suspension of space station
moscow , afp--a russian space expert said that the tragic disintegration of the us space shuttle columbia as it was returning to earth could lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions to the international space station ( iss ) , which depends on us shuttles and russian space craft .
the russian space expert who did not wish to be named told the russian inter fax news agency that the disintegration of the columbia as it re-entered the earth &apos;s atmosphere could force the return of the crew on the iss to earth and the switching of the station to automatic pilot for a certain period .
he said that if it is determined that the accident was due to the age of the craft ; it will cause the americans to freeze flights of all the shuttles to avoid another similar catastrophe .
he added that it is probable that the us will not send astronauts to the station until 2007-2008 , and the construction of new spacecraft would be necessary .
the grounding of the us shuttles would leave russia as the only country which could send astronauts to the station on its soyuz craft , but russia &apos;s space agency faces severe financing problems now . therefore , a deal could possibly be worked out between the us and russian to use soyuz craft to keep manned missions going in the iss , supplying the station by russian progress cargo vessels .
the russian expect thought that the current crew in the iss that were due to return to earth on board the us space shuttle atlantis on march 1 should count on extending its stay in the station .
sixteen countries are part of the iss project , including the united states , russia , japan , canada and france .
the russian expert said that the tragic accident on march 1 shows the unreliability of the shuttles , as russia &apos;s last accident with a craft was in 1971 when it lost three astronauts in a soyuz-11 craft on re-entry .

in a television address , havel thanked his people for their trust , saying , &quot; without your understanding and goodwill i would not have been able to stay in office for even a few moments . &quot;
havel , who braved the stresses of high office despite serious health problems , stepped down as scheduled even though a successor has not yet been found .
speaking earlier today from the same balcony of prague castle from which he first addressed crowds on assuming office on december 29 , 1989 , he thanked hundreds of well-wishers , &quot; i say farewell to you after 13 years as president . &quot;
the 66-year-old writer used to be a dissident , but later turned into a world statesman , which also symbolized the victory of democracy over totalitarianism in europe .
when revolution broke out in czechoslovakia , havel , who used to be a prisoner in communist jails , became president .
three years later , czechoslovakia split into the czech republic and slovakia , and havel remained president of the czech republic .
today havel handed over the seals of offices to prime minister spidla and lower house speaker zaoralek , both of whom set tomorrow to share temporary presidential powers pending election of a successor .

britain predicts chirac will finally back security council resolution authorizing an attack on iraq
london , february 3 , afp--the british government believes french president chirac will finally back a second un security council resolution authorizing an attack on iraq .
the british press reported today that chirac and british prime minister blair are to discuss the latest developments on the iraq crisis when they meet tomorrow in le touquet , northern france .
the headline of the left-wing guardian reads , &quot; chirac will change line on iraq , predicts downing street &quot; , and guardian also quoted sources at the british premier &apos;s office as citing four factors that would make the french president move over to britain &apos;s way of thinking .
the center-right the times , also quoting senior british officials , said that chirac knew that he had already &quot; gone too far &quot; in his anti-war stance and he was amazed to find that seven other european countries had joined britain in signing a pro-us letter on iraq published last week in the international press .
the times quoted a british diplomat as saying that chirac loves being at the center of attention and being coaxed , but he is not a fool ; it may be too much of a volte-face for chirac to change his position tomorrow , but it is hopeful to see that there will be signs that he may move at the summit meeting of heads of state of the two countries .
nearly 3000 troops stationed in south korea are ordered to freeze transfer
seoul , february 3 , afp--the transfer of about 2900 us army officers and soldiers , slated to leave south korea in the next three months , has been frozen to maintain combat readiness , us military authorities said .
the stop-movement order was not directly linked to the nuclear crisis in north korea , but highlights the difficult balance the united states faces between iraq and north korea .
the us 8th army in seoul said today that the rotation freeze was ordered to maintain troop levels in south korea while replacements from us-based units were also being held back amid simultaneous deployments near iraq and in afghanistan .
us 8th army commander lieutenant general campbell said in a statement that the stop-movement order would help us troops keep their strength in south korea .
some 37000 us troops stationed in south korea under a mutual defense pact between south korea and the us have already been on alert since the exposure of north korea &apos;s nuclear ambitions in december last year .
suspected space shuttle debris also discovered in california and arizona in west us
houston , afp--america &apos;s national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) said that suspected debris from the doomed spacecraft columbia has been spotted in the western states of california and arizona too , possibly offering key clues to why the spacecraft broke up in the air .
&quot; we &apos;ve had a number of reports about pieces found on the ground in california and arizona , &quot; said kostelnik , an associate administrator of national aeronautics and space administration .
he said a team of experts had been dispatched to various sites in those states to examine the wreckage , but cautioned that it was not clear what the material is at this point .
shuttle program manager dittemore said on february 3 that nasa had assembled a special team to search for debris west of the parts of texas and louisiana where most of columbia &apos;s remains have been found .
dittemore pointed out that such debris could be significant because it could provide the vital missing link to the disaster .
columbia broke into pieces of flaming debris on february 1 as it descended toward a scheduled 9 : 16 am landing at the kennedy space center in florida . all seven astronauts aboard were killed .
investigators are trying to understand why temperatures on columbia &apos;s left side spiked as much as 16 degrees celsius in the minutes before contact was lost with the spacecraft about the time an unusual amount of drag on the left side caused the shuttle to lose control .
the potential discovery of debris further west than earlier expected is seen as important to understand what destroyed the shuttle , kostelnik said .
&quot; it would be important to see the material early in the sequence , &quot; he said .
south korean envoy calls for us and north korea dialogue
washington , february 4 , afp--president bush faced urgent calls from south korea &apos;s next government and a key congressional ally for direct talks with north korea before a nuclear crisis spins out of control .
a day after stoking the ire of north korea by putting heavy bombers on alert for deployment , senior bush aides were forced to defend washington &apos;s policy towards north korea .
chyung dai-chul , envoy for south korea &apos;s incoming president roh moo-hyun , stressed the position of south korea after meeting secretary of state powell , saying , &quot; we hope that the united states will take a more active role in engaging in dialogue with north korea . &quot;
he also said that dialogue should be in an international setting with a multilateral approach .
meanwhile , the republican party &apos;s senior foreign policy senator lugar issued a striking call for dialogue between the us and north korea as well .
&quot; i believe that united states officials should talk to north korean officials about ending north korean nuclear weapons programs with provisions of comprehensive international inspection , &quot; lugar said .
powell &apos;s number two , armitage told lugar &apos;s senate foreign relations committee that it was a question of when , and not if , us and north korean officials meet .
&quot; of course we are going to have direct talks with north korea . there is no question about that , &quot; said armitage .
but he said that the dialogue would only take place when washington was confident that a &quot; strong international platform &quot; of backing and support for ending pyongyang &apos;s nuclear program had been built .
german unemployment surges to 5-year high in january
frankfurt , february 5 , afp--official data shows that bad winter weather and the chronically ailing economy pushed german unemployment up to a five-year high in january , dealing another heavy blow to chancellor schroder just over 100 days into his second term in office .
further more , the threat of war in iraq further deepened the economic gloom over germany , the euro zone &apos;s biggest economy .
the freeze on the german labour market looks set to continue in the coming months .
data published by the federal labour office in nuremberg showed that the number of people looking for work in germany surged to 4.623 million , or 11.1 percent of the working population in january , the highest monthly level in five years since march 1998 .
in december , the jobless total had stood at 4.225 million , equivalent to a jobless rate of 10.1 percent .
unemployment usually increases during the winter months for seasonal reasons , as companies , particularly in sectors such as the construction industry , lay off employees because of bad weather .
but even after taking such factors into account , the dole queues continued to lengthen last month .
seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank in frankfurt showed that the jobless total shot up to 4.274 million in january from 4.212 million in december .
and the seasonally adjusted jobless rate rose to 10.3 percent from 10.1 percent .
federal labour office chief gerster attributed the sharp rise in the number of job seekers to both the usual winter break and the poor state of the economy .
singapore erc : full economic recovery expected in 2004
singapore , february 6 , afp--singapore economic review committee said that due to global geopolitical and economic uncertainties , the economy in singapore will not make a full recovery until 2004 .
in its annual report of economic review , the erc said , &quot; the singapore economy has still not fully recovered from the 2001 recession . our immediate prospects are clouded by uncertainties in the region , the slowdown in the us , european and japanese economies , the prospect of war in iraq and the significant challenges posed by china . &quot;
but there are still reasonable chances of development for the singapore economy , while full recovery may not appear until 2004 .
the singapore government estimated that this year may achieve an economic growth of 2 % to 5 % , after last year &apos;s 2.2 % , but is still far lower than the average annual growth rate of 7.3 % since 1985 .
the erc also recommended that the restoring of the central provident fund project be postponed for two years before raising the percentage of contribution , so as to avoid adding to the burden on wages for employers at a difficult time , help reducing unemployment , and send a strong signal to foreign investors .

i want to keep myself in my hotel room . but as a basketball player , that is probably a luxury i can never have . &quot;
not when your tummy is at most people &apos;s eye level and your face is flashed across television commercials .
when you are making millions of dollars and replace flying jordan as the leading pitchman of your game , life is a blur .
&quot; everything is happening too rapidly , too fast . &quot; yao ming said .
&quot; you don &apos;t want to get everything at the beginning . you want to get yourself into the nba gradually instead of like this .
but you can &apos;t choose that . &quot;
hingis lives leisurely and has no intention to return to circuit
paris , february 7 , afp--hingis , former world number one swiss tennis player who dominated the women &apos;s circuit from 1997 to 2000 by winning five grand slam singles crowns and eight doubles titles , said today that she had no desire to return to the circuit .
but 21-year-old serena williams believes that hingis is just suffering from burnout because of her early domination after turning professional aged just 14 .
&quot; i don &apos;t think she is officially retired . i think she just wants to take a break . i didn &apos;t get serious until i was 17 and she &apos;d already been around a long time at 17 . sometimes i &apos;m tired too , and i can only imagine how she feels . &quot; said williams after advancing to the semi-finals of the paris indoor open .

bush vows to disarm iraq &quot; one way or the other &quot;
washington , february 14 , afp--us president bush vowed today that iraqi president hussein &apos;s regime would be disarmed &quot; one way or the other &quot; .
&quot; hussein has got weapons of mass destruction and he &apos;s used them ; hussein is used to deceiving the world and continues to do so , &quot; he charged .
&quot; hussein has got ties to terrorist networks too . &quot;
&quot; hussein is a danger , and that &apos;s why he will be disarmed one way or the other , &quot; bush said sternly as he made a speech at fbi headquarters to lay out efforts to thwart terrorist attacks like those of september 11 , 2001 .
this was bush &apos;s first public reaction to a un security council meeting held in new york today .
the meeting was centered on a report by weapons inspectors overseeing iraq &apos;s compliance with no. 1441 un disarmament resolution passed on november 8 last year .
white house spokesman fleischer said that blix had not given any reason to make people believe that iraq is complying with no. 1441 un security council resolution .
&quot; nowhere did the world receive any comfort today in new york that hussein has shown the inspectors that he is disarming , &quot; he told reporters .
&quot; quite the contrary . &quot;
asked when the us would unveil a follow-up resolution aimed at enforcing no. 1441 un security council resolution , fleischer said it was &quot; too soon to say &quot; but that america would consult with its allies on the content and language .
countries such as france , russia and china are still calling for beefed-up inspections as an alternative to us-led war .
fleischer said that bush shares the view that military action is a &quot; last resort &quot; .
but he stuck by bush &apos;s timetable of &quot; weeks not months &quot; before un efforts to drive iraq to disarm peacefully must give way to military action .
new york times : white house developing plans for sanctions against north korea
washington , afp-- the white house is developing plans for sanctions against north korea in the event that pyongyang fails to abandon its efforts to develop nuclear weapons , the new york times reported today , citing us officials .
the sanctions would include halting north korea &apos;s weapons shipments and cutting off money sent there by koreans living in japan , according to the report .
pentagon and state department officials are developing detailed plans for sanctions so that the united states can have a ready response in the event north korea takes new steps toward developing nuclear weapons , the report said .
the first step , according to the new york times , would be to urge the united nations security council , perhaps in the next two weeks , to condemn north korea &apos;s recent steps toward nuclear weaponry , which have included withdrawing from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty and restarting a mothballed reactor at yongbyon that can produce weapons-grade plutonium .
however , washington &apos;s pacific allies still oppose the idea of sanctions against north korea , and the un security council is likely to remain focused on iraq for weeks .
meanwhile , many us officials worry that if the united states attacks iraq , north korea will use the opportunity to push forward with weapons production , the new york times pointed out .
us troops to train on philippines hostage island
philippines , manila , february 17 , afp--united states troops are to be sent to the philippines &apos; island of jolo , which is notorious for hostage taking , to help philippines fight against terrorist threats posed by a muslim rebel group .
&quot; the exercise will form part of philippines &apos; overall and ongoing defense and security cooperation activities with the united states , which continue to focus on increasing our ability to protect ourselves against terrorist threats , &quot; philippine president arroyo &apos;s spokesman bunye said .
&quot; the philippine government and us have yet to set the duration of the operation and the specific number of us soldiers and support troops to be deployed , &quot; he said in a statement .
the philippine defense secretary reyes told reporters that us major general weber was to arrive in the philippines shortly &quot; to discuss dynamics and details of the operation in sulu &quot; .
sulu is a southern philippine island group that includes jolo .
arroyo &apos;s national security adviser golez said that the exercise in sulu would &quot; give the philippine armed forces the most training in anti-terrorism &quot; .
the us government has been boosting military aid to the philippines since the september 11 , 2001 attacks in the united states , worried that al-qaeda islamic militants flushed out by the us-led campaign in afghanistan could have set up bases in southeast asia .
such suspicion was bolstered by the bombing of the bali resort in indonesia last year that killed nearly 200 people .
most of the killed in the bombing of the bali resort were western tourists .
founder of german telephone operator mobilcom schmid declares bankruptcy
hamburg , february 18 , afp--schmid , founder and former chairman of german telephone operator mobilcom , said today that he had declared himself insolvent as a result of the sharp decline in the value of his shares , and that he had filed for insolvency at a court in flensburg , northern germany .
schmid holds just under 40 percent of the company he set up , but the price of mobilcom shares has fallen sharply in view of the company &apos;s financial troubles last year , which pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .
the statement said that schmid &apos;s private assets and property are also involved .
the court had appointed auditor gellert as administrator .
schmid was ousted last year by mobilcom &apos;s major shareholder france telecom in a long running spat over the huge costs of setting up new generation mobile phone networks , dubbed universal mobile telecommunications system , or umts .
in the statement issued by mobilcom later today , the company said that &quot; the personal insolvency of schmid had no effect on mobilcom &apos;s activities or contracts . &quot;
the statement also said that a rescue plan , under which france telecom would assume around seven billion euros in debts , would remain unchanged . the plan also foresees the german government and banks providing about 100 million euros in loans to mobilcom , which employs about 5000 people .

however , senior us military officials say that north korea declared that it would not be bound by the armistice agreement of the korean war as early as in 1994 .
us authorities declared yesterday that the united states and south korea would launch the annual joint military drills on the korean peninsula from march 4 to april 2 .
a south korean official said that south korea sent invitation to north korea yesterday , asking it to send observers to the drills .
the official who did not want to be named said , &quot; the statement of north korea about pulling out of the armistice agreement is obviously a response to the coming joint military exercises between the us and south korea . &quot;
the united states has already ordered 12 b-52 bombers and an equal number of b-1 bombers to prepare to move to the korean peninsula , of which has been sternly accused by north korea .
moreover , japanese media reported yesterday that the united states is planning to boost its military forces in northeast asia with fears rising over north korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program .
indonesian authorities reject plan for us embassy security upgrade
jakarta , february 19 , afp--us embassy in jakarta requested the indonesian authorities to build a three-meter-high perimeter wall to upgrade security of the embassy , but the plan is rejected .
the request to replace the existing fence with a wall at the mission and at the ambassador &apos;s residence was turned down on aesthetic grounds by the indonesian authorities , the jakarta post and the state-run antara news agency both reported today .
a jakarta official quoted city governor sutiyoso as saying a wall could be built but it must stand inside the embassy compound , three meters from the current fence .
in addition , the embassy should lay out gardens and flower beds between the two barriers to improve the appearance of the compound .
sutiyoso said that gardens and flower beds would reduce the impression that the us embassy is a fort .
the embassy was the scene of frequent protests before and after the start in 2001 of the us-led military campaign in afghanistan to oust the taliban leadership .
authorities stepped up security at the mission that year after the previous ambassador accused the jakarta police of failing to act against hardline islamic groups which had been threatening the safety of americans .
it is generally expected that major protests are inevitable if the us launches a war against iraq

research shows a father &apos;s genes may influence the timing of his child &apos;s birth
paris , february 28 , afp--a father &apos;s genes may influence the timing of his child &apos;s birth , according to a danish study published in next saturday &apos;s issue of the weekly british medical journal .
about five percent of births are late , which means a pregnancy lasts 294 days or more .
the problem is known to cause health complications for mother and child , but exactly why it happens is an enigma .
the danish researchers looked at 43,000 births between 1980-92 among women who had had two children or more and whose first pregnancy had gone into extra time .
only their first two deliveries were used in the analysis .
overall , nearly 20 percent of the women who had had a prolonged first pregnancy had the same experience for their second child .
but this figure fell to just over 15 percent when the first and second child had different fathers .
lead author of the research olesen told afp , &quot; that &apos;s a lot .
it means that if you have the same partner ( for your second child ) , you have a 30-percent greater likelihood of a prolonged pregnancy compared with someone who changes partner . &quot;
&quot; women had a reduced risk of recurrent post-term delivery if they changed partner between pregnancies , &quot; the study says .
&quot; we believe that this is a new observation .
this result suggests that the timing of birth may be determined by paternal genes . &quot;

patients of chronic pains are very sensitive to pains , and have to live with great pain in everyday life to the end .
however , people still know almost nothing of its causes .
according to the austrian news agency , a research team led by yuergen sandequle , dean of the neuropathology department of brain research institute of vienna university , discovered , when making a biopsy of tissue section , that some spinal cord cells show no unusual performance normally , but will have excited reactions when stimulated by pain .
the greater the pain stimuli , the greater the reaction .
however , unlike other neurons , this group of spinal cord cells will then become over sensitive to pain stimulus . a slight pain will make it over excited .
researchers also discovered that there is a special passageway in the spinal cord cells , which will be opened when the cells are stimulated , and calcium ions will get in , causing chain reactions .
sandequle thinks that the reason for the sensitiveness of patients of chronic pains to slight pains is that the neurons in the spinal cord have permanent memories and retain the &quot; trace of pain &quot; .
he said that this discovery may lead people to look for ways to eliminate such memories .
