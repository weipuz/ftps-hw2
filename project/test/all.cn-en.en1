australia reopened manila embassy
( agence france-presse , manila , 2nd ) - australia reopened its embassy in the philippines today . the embassy was closed seven weeks ago after what was described as a specific threat of a terrorist attack .
philippine foreign department said in a statement that australian ambassador to manila ruth pearce phoned philippine foreign secretary blas ople to announce the resumption of full operations of the embassy .
canada and the european union , which both shut down their embassies like australia on november 28 , have reopened their embassies earlier this week .

the closure of the embassies had angered the philippine government , which said that the alleged threats were exaggerated and the closure of embassies harmed the image of philippines .
manila had once relieved the duty of a police intelligence official because he leaked unverified intelligence about terrorist threats on australian and canadian embassies .
the european union office is in the same building as the australian embassy .
at the time around the anniversary of the 911 terrorist attacks in united states , western diplomatic missions across southeast asia have closed their doors one after the other because of threats related to osama bin laden &apos;s al-qaeda organization and its regional allies .
australian foreign minister : north korea &apos;s bad behavior could not win more aid
( agence france-presse , sydney , 2nd ) - australia called for a concerted international effort to convince north korea that it cannot win more aid or other concessions by defying the nuclear non-proliferation agreement or through other &quot; bad behavior &quot; .
australian foreign minister alexander downer said today that pyongyang &apos;s decision to restart a controversial nuclear facility and expel united nations inspectors was obviously aimed at forcing international community to make concessions in aid and trade .
australia is one of the several countries that have diplomatic relations with north korea .
&quot; we believe what north korea wants to do is to violate the agreed framework put into place in 1994 , such as to obtain concessions , aid and trade etc. from other countries in the world , including the united states , &quot; downer said .
&quot; we want to raise a point to north korea and it is a very important point . bad behavior is not going to be rewarded , &quot; downer said during an interview by australia broadcasting corporation .
&quot; the kind of behavior , like expelling united nations inspectors and reactivating the yongbyon nuclear facility , will only cause the international community to hold back their supports , &quot; he said .
&quot; it is going to create an opposite effect . we hope that diplomatic measures are going to be effective . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , if we are to overreact , we will fall into north korea &apos;s trap .
we do not want to do that . &quot;
downer said australia is working closely with the united states and other key allies to force north korea to revoke its recent steps for restarting a previously frozen nuclear program .
&quot; what we want to do is to ensure that international community adopts a common countermeasure . we do not want any uncoordinated and ad hoc responses , &quot; he said .
bush defends his economic stimulus plan

whether the plan can go through smoothly is generally viewed as a foretaste of the battle in the 2004 u.s. presidential election . democrats accused that president bush &apos;s blueprint will only give the rich additional splendor and is unlike the democrat &apos;s proposed plan , which tries to send the poor charcoals during a snowy weather .
the eight-point democratic proposal revolved around a us $ 136 billion incentive package to stimulate consumer spending . over 10 years , the democratic plan would cost us $ 100 billion .
&quot; this is a fair , fast-acting and fiscally sound plan , &quot; said nancy pelosi , the democratic leader in the house of representatives , during a joint press conference with other opposition congress members .
bush led the white house to retort outsiders &apos; allegations that the plan only benefits the rich . bush said the economic stimulus plan , that he is going to unveil , focuses on &quot; stimulating economic vitality and growth &quot; .
bush said , &quot; this plan will provide tax cuts and concessions to the working class .
the plan recognizes that people can only spend money when they have more money to spare . it is only then will more jobs be created . &quot;

north korea withdrew from nuclear non-proliferation treaty and becomes a foe of the world
( agence france-presse , washington , 15th ) - the showdown between united states and north korea has elevated from a side issue of &quot; axis of evil &quot; to an international crisis . it appears that the global efforts for nuclear non-proliferation in the past several decades are likely to fall short of success for lack of a final effort .
pyongyang announced its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on the 10th of this month and is poised to confront with washington .
analysts said the global endeavor and attempt to curb nuclear proliferation have the fear of a failure . the treaty was already seriously damaged when non-treaty countries , pakistan and india , joined the nuclear club in 1998 .
four days after pyongyang adopted the aforesaid action , the five permanent members of united nations security council have all taken preemptive diplomatic actions for the crisis .
russia said it would send a special envoy to pyongyang with a proposal to end the stalemate . on the other hand , china suggested to host dialogues for a possible compromise between united states and north korea .
britain and france discussed the crisis in london .
international atomic energy agency warned that it might demand actions by the security council if pyongyang refuses to abandon its nuclear plan .
as to the actions of russia and china , many u.s. observers believed this kind of talks might force moscow and beijing to decide whether to cast a veto vote for north korea .
other countries that might have nuclear capability , for example , iran and libya , are certainly monitoring closely the development of the north korea crisis .
they would be interested to know whether north korea can withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty without any penalty , or would united states offer huge sums to north korea in exchange for a cessation in nuclear weapon development .
&quot; if north korea is considered to have the ability to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , then these countries may contemplate that they could also adopt the same action without paying any price , &quot; said robert einhorn , former assistant secretary of state for weapon non-proliferation .
marcus noland of the institute for international economics believed that north korea might have committed a tactical mistake . it is because the decision to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty may strengthen the determination of the international community to solve this problem .
japanese court rejected compensation claims by former chinese slave laborers
( agence france-presse , tokyo , 15th ) - a japanese court today rejected compensation suits for a total amount of 132 million yen ( us $ 1.1 million ) . six chinese people brought up the suits because they were forced into slave labor in a nickel mine in japan during world war ii .
kyoto district court judge shin kusumoto said the government and nippon yakin kogyo co . , ltd. had both acted illegally in 1944 . however , he rejected the demand for compensation because there is a 20-year statute of limitation for compensation claims under civil law .
&quot; the defendants &apos; obligations had exhausted , &quot; kusumoto said .
five former slave laborers , including liu zonggen , 72 , and the family of a deceased man , were demanding unpaid wages , compensation and an apology from the japanese government and nippon yakin kogyo co . , ltd .
the six men had worked as slave laborers in nippon yakin kogyo co . , ltd. for one year . during that period , they were often beaten ; not given enough food ; and not enough clothing to keep warm .
nippon yakin kogyo co . , ltd. argued that the company had no power to resist policies implemented by the state . the japanese government said that it had no obligation to compensate the plaintiffs under the constitution back then .
jiji news reported that in a press conference after the court announced the decision , liu zonggen said , &quot; the ruling is lack of humanity &quot; .
he said that the plaintiffs would appeal .
&quot; i have received a lot of support from friends in japan and i will fight to the end , &quot; liu zonggen said .
the plaintiffs &apos; lawyers said the ruling is an &quot; unprecedented in history &quot; . they demand the japanese government and nippon yakin kogyo co . , ltd. to pay the compensation and make an apology to solve the problem .
according to kyodo news , it is the first occasion that this kind of defenses were rejected by court in lawsuits for war related compensations .
in 1944 , the japanese army arrested about two hundred chinese people and brought them to a nickel mine in kaya , kyoto prefecture to work as slave labor .

daschle said president bush should provide concrete proof of saddam &apos;s wrong doings
( agence france-presse , washington , 28th ) - democratic senate leader tom daschle brought up a dissenting view and challenged president george w. bush to present proof that iraq has weapons of mass destruction . he also questioned whether the white house has a &quot; guiding principle &quot; to justify a war against saddam hussein .
&quot; if we have proof that iraq possesses nuclear and biological weapons , why are we not showing them to the world ? just like president kennedy did 40 years ago when he instructed u.s. ambassador to united nations ( un ) adlai stevenson to show photographs of offensive missiles in cuba to the world during a un meeting , &quot; daschle asked .
in a presentation at the national press club in washington , daschle launched his fierce criticism on president bush at a time when un weapons inspectors submitted a report to un security council as to whether iraq has complied with the disarmament orders .
&quot; at a time when we have just begun to fight the war on terrorism , the american people have the right to know why we should risk the lives of thousands of american soldiers and send them to the battle field . why u.s. has to spend billions of dollars , spare nothing to offend our allies and provoke our adversaries to attack iraq , &quot; he said .
&quot; in a democracy , it is very important that the president should do everything possible to answer those questions and address the people &apos;s doubts , &quot; daschle said .
he referred to public opinion polls , which showed the american people &apos;s support to president bush declined steadily .
the white house has given so many rotating reasons to illustrate the urgency to overturn iraqi president saddam hussein , which included a threat to neighbor countries ; poisoned kurds ; attempted to kill former president george bush ; alleged involvement in september 11 attacks ; and manufacturing of weapons of mass destruction . it makes people wonder which one is the real one .
&quot; it makes people doubt that the government already has a highest guiding principle , &quot; he said .

shuttle program manager ron dittemore said on the 3rd that nasa has already set up a special team , which is responsible to search areas west of texas and louisiana , where the bulk of debris from space shuttle columbia were found .

investigators are trying to understand why the left side of the shuttle showed a sharp temperature spike of 16 degrees just a few minutes before communication was cut off . at about the same time , there was an unusual drag on the left side of the space shuttle , which caused it to lose control .
kostelnik said the possibility of finding debris at spots west of the expected areas is viewed as crucial for finding the cause of the accident .

seasonally adjusted data published separately by the bundesbank in frankfurt showed that the number of unemployed surged to 4.274 million in january from the 4.212 million in december last year .
meanwhile , the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.3 percent from 10.1 percent .

it was bush &apos;s first public reaction to a united nations ( un ) security council meeting in new york today .
the meeting focused on hearing the report from the chief of weapons inspectors as to whether iraq has compiled with resolution 1441 adopted by the security council on november 8 last year , which requires iraq to disarm .
white house spokesman ari fleischer said hans blix has not provided any reason to convince any one that iraq is complying with un security council resolution 1441 .
he told reporters , &quot; the world did not hear any comfortable news from new york today , which would lead us to believe saddam hussein has shown the inspectors that he is disarming .
the situation is quite the contrary . &quot;
when fleischer was asked about the timing for washington to propose a resolution aimed at enforcing resolution 1441 , he said it was &quot; too soon to say &quot; but washington would consult its allies on the language to be used in its content .
countries such as france , russia and china etc. are still calling for more stringent inspections rather than a u.s. led war against iraq .
fleischer said bush shares the view that military action is the &quot; last resort &quot; .
however , he insisted on the timetable laid down by bush . that is un only has &quot; weeks but not months &quot; to try to disarm iraq peacefully and it would be military action thereafter .
new york times : white house drafting north korea sanction
( agence france-presse , washington ) - new york times today quoted an u.s. official , who said white house is drafting sanction measures for use in event that the pyongyang authority does not abandon its nuclear weapon initiative .
according to the report , the sanction measures will include the prohibition of weapon delivery to north korea and cut off remittance by koreans residing in japan to north korea .
the report pointed out that pentagon and state department officials are drafting a detailed sanction plan such that u.s. can make a response at any time when north korea moves towards new measures in the research and development of nuclear weapons .
according to the report in new york times , the first step is to urge united nations security council to condemn north korea &apos;s recent moves towards nuclear weapons , including its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the restart of the sealed yongbyon nuclear facility , which is capable of producing weapon-grade plutonium . the timing is likely to be the next two weeks .
however , washington &apos;s pacific allies are still against the concept of a sanction on north korea . furthermore , united nations security council may have to focus on the iraq problem in the next several weeks .
new york times also pointed out that many u.s. officials worry that should u.s. starts an attack on iraq , north korea may take the opportunity to advance its weapon production .

( agence france-presse , manila , philippines , 17th ) - united states military trainers are to be sent to philippines &apos; hostage island - jolo island , this year to help philippine deal with terrorists threats associated with a muslim rebel group .

sulu is a southern philippines island group that includes the jolo island .
arroyo &apos;s national security advisor roilo golez said the training exercise in sulu would provide &quot; maximum training to the philippine armed forces in the area of anti-terrorism &quot; .
since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the united states , u.s. government has been boosting military aid to philippines on worries that some al-qaeda islamic militants , who were flushed out by the u.s. led military action in afghanistan , could have set up bases in southeast asia .
the bombing of the bali resort in indonesia last year , which killed nearly 200 people , evidenced the aforesaid doubt .
most of those killed in bali were western tourists .

( agence france-presse , hamburg , 18th ) - gerhard schmid , the founder and former chairman of german telecommunications company mobilcom , said today that he had applied to a court in flensburg , northern germany , to declare himself bankrupt because of a sharp fall in the value of his mobilcom shares .
schmid is holding about 40 percent of the company that he found . however , the price of mobilcom shares has fallen sharply over the last year because of financial problems inside the company , which pushed it to the brink of bankruptcy .
schmid &apos;s statement said his personal assets and real estates are also involved .

u.s. and south korea to launch military exercise in march and north korea threatens to withdraw from the armistice agreement
( agence france-presse , seoul , 18th ) - south korea and u.s. are preparing to launch a large scale military exercise in early march , which will last for about one month . north korea &apos;s response is a threat to pull out from the armistice agreement , which ended the korean war .
as the tensions in the nuclear stalemate over the past four months has no sign of any alleviation , the general interpretation for north korea &apos;s threatened pull out from the armistice agreement is that pyongyang tries to make a response to the march joint military maneuver between u.s. and south korea announced yesterday .
north korea military has charged the united states for repeated violation of the armistice agreement . it said in a statement , &quot; if the u.s. side continues to violate and misuse the armistice agreement at will , north korea has no need to observe the armistice agreement under an uncomfortable situation .
the future development will depend entirely on the attitude of the u.s. side . &quot;
however , a u.s. high level military official said north korea had indicated that they were no longer abided by the armistice agreement as early as 1994 .
u.s. authority announced yesterday that u.s. and south korea would conduct their annual joint military exercise in the korean peninsula . the timing is between march 4 and april 2 .
a south korea government official said south korea had already sent an invitation to north korea yesterday asking them to send observers to view and learn from the military exercise .
&quot; north korea &apos;s statement about pulling out from the armistice agreement is clearly made in response to the joint military exercise between south korea and u.s. , &quot; said the official , who declined to be named .
the united states has ordered twelve b-52 bombers and an equal number of b-1 bombers to prepare to move to the korean peninsula in earlier times . north korea severely condemned the move .
furthermore , japanese media reported yesterday that u.s. is planning to strengthen its military force in the northeast asia as a precaution against doubts arising as a result of north korea &apos;s nuclear weapon plan .
indonesian authority rejected u.s. embassy security upgrade plan
( agence france-presse , jakarta , 19th ) - u.s. embassy in jakarta has proposed to indonesian authority the construction of a three-meter-high perimeter wall to upgrade embassy security but the plan was rejected .
both the &quot; jakarta post &quot; and the state-owned &quot; antara &quot; news agency reported today that jakarta authority rejected the request to replace the existing fence , which separates the embassy and the ambassador &apos;s residence from the outside world , with a wall because of aesthetic reasons .
a jakarta official quoted city governor sutiyoso as saying a wall could be built , but the prerequisite is to build it three meters from the current fence inside the embassy compound .
in addition , the embassy should lay turf and plant flowers between the two barriers to improve the appearance of the embassy compound .
sutiyoso said gardening and landscaping could reduce the impression that the u.s. embassy is a fort .
the u.s. embassy in jakarta had faced frequent protests before and after the u.s. led military actions in afghanistan aimed at ousting the taliban regime in 2001 .
at that year , the related authority had stepped up security at the embassy after the previous ambassador protested that the police failed to curb the hard-line islamic groups , which had been threatening the safety of americans .
the general expectation is that large-scale protests are unavoidable if u.s. launches a war against iraq .

research indicates a father &apos;s genes may influence the timing of his child &apos;s birth
( agence france-presse , paris , 28th ) - according to a danish research to be published in coming saturday &apos;s issue of the weekly british medical journal , a father &apos;s genes may influence the timing of his child &apos;s birth .
about five percent of the expectant mothers experienced a post-term delivery , which is a pregnancy with a length of 294 days or more .
at present , it is known that the problem may cause health complications for mother and child , but why it happens is an enigma .
danish researchers tracked 43,000 births between 1980-92 . women with at least two children and , whose first pregnancy was a post-term delivery , were listed as targets .
only the first two deliveries were used in the analysis .
in general , nearly 20 percent of the women who came through a prolonged first pregnancy had the same experience in their second pregnancy .
however , this figure fell to just over 15 percent when the first and second child had different fathers .
annette wind olesen , the lead author of the research report , told agence france-presse , &quot; that is a lot .
that means if you have the same partner ( for your second child ) , you have a 30-percent greater likelihood of a prolonged pregnancy compared with someone who has changed partner . &quot;
the research report said , &quot; the risk of recurrence of post-term delivery was reduced when women changed partner between pregnancies .
we believe this is a new observation .
this result suggests that the timing of birth may , in part , be determined by the father &apos;s genes . &quot;

u.s. department of defense cancelled two missile intercept tests
xinhua news agency , washington , january 8 ( reporter : tan xinmu ) - richard lehner , spokesman of missile defense agency , u.s. department of defense said on the 8th that u.s. military decided to skip two scheduled missile intercept tests in the first half of this year , because the development of a new rocket booster , used for launching the interceptor , was arrear of original schedule .
lehner told media here that the missile defense agency has to concentrate on solving the rocket booster problem this year . the next missile intercept test will take place in autumn after boeing company produces a new rocket booster .
under the original schedule , boeing company was to conduct flight tests of a new type of rocket booster that could carry the &quot; interceptor &quot; starting from 2000 . however , that was delayed due to technical reasons .
after a launch of the rocket booster failed in december 2001 , the boeing company decided to re-design the rocket booster , which was scheduled to complete in autumn this year .
u.s. military used modified minuteman rockets as booster in the last 8 ground-based missile intercept tests . however , the result of this type of booster was not satisfactory .
the missile intercept test in july 2000 and december last year had both failed because the &quot; interceptor &quot; did not separate properly from the rocket booster .
u.s. president george w. bush ordered the department of defense to start the deployment of the missile defense system on december 17 last year and hoping to complete an initial missile defense system by september 2004 .
however , many experts believed that it is premature to deploy a missile defense system judging from the technological achievement .
the head of missile defense agency ronald kadish also said that should the boeing company fail to produce a qualified rocket booster as scheduled , then the deployment of the whole missile defense system would be affected .

a war on iraq may cause abundant supply in international oil market
xinhua news agency , riyadh , january 22 - saudi arabian newspaper al-watan quoted on 22nd the words of shakib khalil , algerian minister of energy and mines , who said the organization of the petroleum exporting countries ( opec ) cannot cover the daily shortage of 5 million barrels of crude oil in international markets in event of a war on iraq .
khalil said , among the members of opec , only saudi arabia and united arab emirates have the capacity to increase production .
&quot; opec has a problem in meeting with demands in the market because only saudi arabia and united arab emirates have spare capacity to increase production , but they can only produce 3 million barrels a day , &quot; he said .
since december last year , the price of crude oil in international markets keeps on surging due to the massive strike in venezuela and the threat of an iraq war .
opec decided on the 12th in vienna to increase the daily production of crude oil by 1.5 million barrels starting from february .
as u.s. and britain continue to dispatch soldiers to the gulf areas , the threat of an iraq war has not receded and hence , oil price in international markets continued to surge on the 21st .
khalil said the current oil price in international markets is affected more by tensions in international politics than actual demand and supply .
the customs department at shenzhen luohu is severely cracking down money smuggling
xinhua news agency , shenzhen , january 25 ( li nanling and li xiangzhi ) - the customs department at shenzhen luohu is severely cracking down any money smuggling through this tourist inspection channel , while preserving a civilized and highly efficient supervision .
last year , customs at luohu detected 1023 cases of money smuggling involving more than 150 million renminbi . among these cases , 15 cases had a single case value of more than 500 thousand renminbi ( excluding cases involving foreign currency money orders ) .
as china &apos;s biggest tourist inspection port , the luohu customs is given the job to supervise a tourist flow of 250 thousand person-times a day . if the rather common phenomenon of carrying more than the permitted amount of money is not tightly controlled , then there could be a considerable amount of currency drain every day .
facing a situation like this , the customs at luohu have finally adopted strict monitoring measures , including more frequent and more careful checks , in order to keep a sharp eye on possible money drain from china .
at about 9 : 00 a.m. on february 19 last year , a custom officer spotted a middle age woman who was pulling a suitcase and moving along in a very fast pace .
as the luggage case passed through the inspection machine , the custom officer noticed some suspicious object inside the suitcase . the officer requested the tourist to open the suitcase for inspection and was astonished to find three large bundles of hong kong dollars in thousand dollar bills inside a black plastic bag . the total value was 3 million hong kong dollars .
that was the most serious case of a tourist carrying cash items in excess of permitted limit at luohu customs in two years .
around july and august last year , offshore &quot; black market money changers &quot; attempted to smuggle a large quantity of foreign currency out of china . these changers wanted to take advantage of the massive tourists flow in summer holiday , as well as the renovation undergoing at the luohu port , which caused officers to work in a crowed environment .
the customs at luohu attached high importance to the issue and re-deployed manpower on a priority basis . the officers were determined to crack down any foreign currency smuggling activities by &quot; black market money changers &quot; .
during july 2 to august 11 , customs at luohu detected 4 cases of foreign currency smuggling by &quot; black market money changers &quot; , which had an equivalent value of 1.46 million renminbi .

that growth included an increase of 6.1 percent in spending on durable goods and a small increase of 0.2 percent in spending on non-durable goods and services .
the numbers symbolized a less than robust spending in festival seasons in america .
personal consumption expenditures , which accounted for two-thirds of u.s. gross domestic products , showed a scant increase of 1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year . that growth was far lower than 4.2 percent in the third quarter and was the lowest quarterly growth since the first quarter of 1993 .
economic analysts believed that uncertain factors , including the looming u.s. war against iraq , sharp decline in stock market and a soft job market etc . , had inhibited the zeal to consume , which , in turn , becomes an important factor for a rapid slowdown in the u.s. economy in the fourth quarter .
for the whole year , u.s. personal consumption expenditures increased by 4.5 percent in last year , which was about the same growth as in 2001 .
the report also indicated that u.s. personal income increased by 0.4 percent in december last year .
for the whole year , u.s. personal income increased by 3 percent in last year , which was lower than the 3.3 percent growth in 2001 .

the report said residential construction spending amounted to us $ 434.6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in december last year , up 2.9 percent over november .
analysts believed the low interest rate was an important factor for the strong growth in residential construction spending .
at present , u.s. federal reserve committee maintains short-term interest at 1.2 percent , which is the lowest level in 41 year .
however , u.s. commercial construction spending showed an opposite trend to that of residential construction . in december last year , u.s. commercial construction spending was us $ 158.6 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate , a decrease of 1.9 percent over november .
analysts believed enterprises were unwilling to increase investments in factories and other facilities because there were uncertain factors affecting the future prospect of the u.s. economy .
in addition , worries of terrorists &apos; attacks also weighted against commercial construction activities . president george w. bush signed the terrorism risk insurance act in november last year but the law cannot remove all concerns of investors and businesses .
judging from the performance of the whole year , the growth rate of u.s. residential construction spending decreased from 2.7 percent in 2001 to 0.4 percent , which was the lowest level since 1991 .

( international ) austrian researchers found the spinal cells responsible for chronic pain
xinhua news agency , vienna , february 20 ( reporter : lin chuan ) - researchers from austria &apos;s university of vienna found a set of neuro-cells , which possesses long-lasting memory capability and shows a strong excitation on any slight pain stimulus . this could be another step forward for the identification of the causes of chronic pains .
sufferers of chronic pain are highly sensitive to pains and in the course of time , must endure pains in their daily lives .
however , people have little knowledge about the cause of this illness .
according to austria presse agentur , a team of researchers led by juergen sandkuehler , head of neurophysiology division , brain research institute , university of vienna , found that certain spinal cells had no unusual behavior under normal condition but showed excitation after pain stimulus in a tissue biopsy .
the stronger the pain stimulus is , the stronger the reaction .
however , they differ from other neuro-cells in that this set of spinal cells become over sensitive to pain stimulus . they break out even on the stimulus of insignificant pains .
researchers also found that spinal cells have a special channel . when the cells were stimulated , the channel would open , calcium ions poured in and triggered further chain reactions .
sandkuehler believed that the long-lasting memory of this type of spinal cells retains &quot; traces of pain &quot; and is the cause of over sensitive reaction to slight pains that chronic pain sufferers are experiencing .
he said the discovery could guide people to find methods to remove this type of memory .
