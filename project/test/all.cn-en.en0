scientists complete sequencing of the chromosome linked to early dementia
( afp , paris , january 2 ) an international team of scientists said that they have completed the sequencing of human chromosome 14 that is linked to many diseases , including the early-onset alzheimer &apos;s that may strike people in their 30s .
this is the fourth chromosome whose sequence has been completed to date . it comprises more than 87 million pairs of dna .
this study published in the weekly british scientific journal nature illustrates that the sequence of chromosome 14 comprises 1,050 genes and gene fragments .
the goal of geneticists is to provide diagnostic tools to identify defective genes that cause diseases so as to arrive eventually at treatments that can prevent those genes from malfunctioning .
the international scientists led by genoscope , a french gene research center , said that chromosome 14 contains two clusters of genes that are linked to the function of our immune system and more than 60 disease genes .
chromosome 14 has been identified in earlier studies on a great number of diseases such as spastic paraplegia that afflicts young children , missing teeth , several forms of vision and hearing impairments and early-onset alzheimer &apos;s .
about 200,000 americans suffer from early-onset alzheimer &apos;s , accounting for 5 % of alzheimer &apos;s patients in the entire united states .
humans have a total of 23 pairs of chromosomes .
in the past three years , the sequencing of three chromosomes has been completed , including chromosomes 20 , 21 , and 22 .
australia reopens embassy in manila
( afp , manila , january 2 ) australia reopened its embassy in the philippines today , which was shut down about seven weeks ago due to what was described as a specific threat of a terrorist attack .
the philippine foreign department said in a statement that pearce , australian ambassador to manila , has telephoned the philippine foreign secretary ople to announce the resumption of full operations of the embassy .
like australia , canada and the european union closed their embassies on november 28 and reopened them earlier this week .
ople said that all three ambassadors are satisfied with the heightened security measures the philippine government has taken .
the closure of the embassies had angered the philippine government , which said the alleged threat was exaggerated and the closure of the embassies harmed the image of the philippines .
manila fired the police intelligence official because he leaked the unverified intelligence about terrorist threats upon the australian and canadian embassies .
the eu office and the australian embassy are housed in the same building .
around the anniversary of the sept . 11 terrorist attacks on the united states , western diplomatic missions across southeast asia shut down one after another because they received threats linked to osama bin laden &apos;s al-qaeda network and its regional allies .
australian foreign minister says north korea &apos;s bad behaviors will not gain more aid
( afp , sydney , january 2 ) australia has called on the international community to work together to convince north korea that holding nuclear non-proliferation treaty in contempt or other &quot; bad behaviors &quot; will not gain it more aid or other concessions .
australian foreign minister downer noted today that pyongyang &apos;s decisions to reactivate a controversial nuclear facility and to expel un monitors are obviously aimed at forcing the international community into making aid and trade concessions .
australia is one of the few countries that have diplomatic relations with north korea .
downer said : &quot; we think what north korea wants to do is to gain concessions , aid and trade , etc. from the rest of the world , including the united states , by violating the agreed framework signed in 1994 . &quot;
in an interview with the australian broadcasting cooperation , downer said : &quot; one point we &apos;d like to make to north korea and a very important one at that , is that bad behaviors will not be rewarded . &quot;
downer pointed out : &quot; such behaviors as expelling un monitors and reactivating the nuclear facility at yongbyon are going to prevent the international community from providing support . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s going to produce the reverse effect . we hope these diplomatic measures will be effective . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , if we overreact , we will fall for north korea &apos;s trick .
we don &apos;t want to do that . &quot;
downer indicated that australia is working closely with the united states and other major allies to pressure north korea to cancel its recent steps to reactivate the frozen nuclear program .
downer said : &quot; what we want to do is to ensure that the international community make concerted efforts . we don &apos;t want to take any uncoordinated special countermeasures . &quot;
bush defends his economic stimulus package
( afp , washington , january 6 ) us president bush vowed that the economic stimulus package he is going to unveil will benefit the &quot; working people , &quot; and not just the wealthy . it is generally believed that the wealthy can expect to benefit the most from this plan that urges dramatic tax cuts .
bush told reporters who are expecting him to officially announce this package in chicago : &quot; tomorrow , all of you will hear me saying : the us economy is one of the strongest in the world .
however , we believe the us economy can be even stronger than it is now . &quot;
bush is expected to unveil an economic stimulus package that carries a 10-year price tag of 600 billion us dollars , half of which will be used towards eliminating taxes on dividends paid to shareholders . he will also call for accelerating the tax rate cuts approved by the us congress in 2001 .
whether the package can be smoothly promoted is viewed as the front battle of the 2004 us presidential election . the democrats attacked bush &apos;s blueprint as an additional bonus to the wealthy , unlike the democratic proposal which is intended as an aid to the most needy .
the eight-point proposal put forward by the democrats centers around an incentive measure of 136 billion us dollars to stimulate consumer spending which will cost 100 billion us dollars over a period of ten years .
house democratic leader pelosi said at a joint press conference with other opposition lawmakers : &quot; this is a fair , fast-acting , and fiscally sound plan . &quot;
bush led the white house in refuting the accusation from the media that his package only benefits the wealthy , claiming that the economic stimulus package he is going to unveil is chiefly targeted at &quot; revving up economic vitality and growth . &quot;
bush said : &quot; this package will provide tax relief to the working people .
the idea behind the package is that when people have extra money , they are likely to spend it , which can create more jobs . &quot;
us willing to negotiate with north korea but not to pay more compensation
( afp , washington , january 7 ) the united states expressed today its willingness to negotiate with north korea , a hostile nation on the &quot; axis of evil , &quot; but will not provide any fresh inducements to this financially struggling communist nation so as to make it abandon its nuclear program .
us president bush &apos;s administration is currently facing a double crisis with iraq and north korea . the bush administration officials issued a statement after their talks with senior japanese and south korean diplomats , saying that this signals &quot; a step forward &quot; in the us policy toward pyongyang .
the statement said : &quot; the us delegation is willing to talk with north korea about how it should meet its obligation to the international community .
however , the us delegation emphasized that the united states will not provide any compensation for north korea to live up to its existing obligation . &quot;
the us officials insisted with carefully worded diplomatic rhetoric that although they are willing to negotiate with north korea , they will not consider any negotiation procedures before north korea abides by various agreements on banning nuclear weapons .
the state department spokesman boucher said : &quot; we are not willing to pay again for the agreements that have been reached already . &quot;
before that , the bush administration indicated that the united states will refuse to have talks with north korea before this stalinist nation abandons its nuclear program based on enriched uranium and plutonium .
former executive of a us online real estate company to plead guilty to fraud charges
( afp , los angeles ) prosecutors said that a former chief executive of &quot; homestore , &quot; a us online real estate company , has agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges and reached a settlement over the lawsuit that originated from the insider trading scandal .
special assistant us attorney wilner said that kalina , homestore &apos;s former senior manager of mergers and acquisitions , has entered a plea bargain deal and agreed to plead guilty to one count of securities fraud involving insider trading .
fuchs , another prosecutor , said that kalina also agreed to pay 70,000 us dollars to settle a civil lawsuit against him by the us securities and exchange commission .
wilner said that the maximum sentence for securities fraud can be ten years of imprisonment . however , according to the plea bargain deal , the aforementioned term is expected to be &quot; dramatically shortened . &quot;
the prosecutors and investigators pointed out , in the financial fraud scheme in which kalina was involved , homestore &apos;s chief executives misled investors by overstating the 2001 revenues .
fuchs said , when kalina became aware of the artificially inflated stock price , he dumped his homestore shares to make a profit . &quot; the wall street wasn &apos;t aware that the key portion of homestore &apos;s revenues was bogus . &quot;
desimone , homestore &apos;s former vice president who has been charged with similar insider trading , has pleaded guilty . the court is scheduled to announce sentencing on april 21 .
homestore &apos;s chief operating officer giesecke and former chief financial officer joseph shew have pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit securities fraud .
prosecutors said that giesecke and joseph shew , together with other company chief executives , have been charged with overstating revenues by falsifying homestore &apos;s accounting .

worldwatch institute praises environmental revolution
( afp , washington , january 9 ) in its annual report &quot; state of the world , &quot; worldwatch institute , an environmental research organization , praised with unusual optimism the advent of &quot; environmental revolution , &quot; pointing out that many countries are successfully curbing or solving environmental , health and social problems .
flavin , head of worldwatch institute , said on the 9th : &quot; building a world that not only meets our needs but also allows future generations to enjoy a healthy society is no longer a day dream . &quot;
this edition of state of the world report points out that one of the encouraging achievements is the increasing use of renewable energies such as &quot; solar energy and wind power &quot; in germany , japan and spain .
speaking about the success of promoting the strategy of renewable energies , flavin said : &quot; we &apos;re entering a new era . &quot;
the above-mentioned report says that in the 1990s , the worldwide production of chlorofluorocarbons , &quot; the no. 1 culprit in destroying the ozone layer , &quot; has decreased by 81 % .
in addition , the anti-polio campaigns promoted by the world health organization have reduced polio cases globally from 350,000 in 1988 to 480 in 2001 .
this washington-based environmental research organization also praised local successes in environmental protection . for example , the netherlands has achieved an 86 percent recycling rate for automobiles ; denmark has totally banned the use of aluminum cans in favor of recyclable glass bottles ; and brazil has been using renewable energies since 2001 .
the organization &apos;s report says that the past achievements have brought hopes for relieving serious global threats , which include malaria that claims 7,000 lives every day , and the food , air , and water pollution that leads to the untimely deaths of 5,500 children every day .

( afp , washington , january 12 ) aol time warner chairman case announced tonight that he will resign in may , saying that this move is &quot; the best for the company . &quot;

case , who oversaw america online &apos;s merger with time warner which was approved by the us federal trade commission in january 2001 , will remain as a board member of aol time warner .
the merger was valued at 155 billion us dollars when it was announced in january 2000 . the merger was approved by the european policy makers later that year .
case said in a statement : &quot; as you expected , this decision is personally very difficult for me , because i hoped to serve as chairman of this conglomerate for years to come . and as an architect of the merger , i have always thought it was important that i stay as chairman and help get things back on track . &quot;
he stressed : &quot; first of all , this company does not need uneasiness at this critical moment . as some shareholders still focus their dissappointment with the company &apos;s post-merger performance on me personally , i have decided that we should take steps now to prevent it from hindering our cooperation as a team and to focus fully on our businesses . &quot;
aol time warner &apos;s internet arm , america online , said that it expects its advertising and commerce sales for 2002 to drop to between 1.5 to 1.6 billion us dollars from 2.7 billion in 2001 .

north korea withdraws from nuclear non-poliferation treaty to defy the entire world
( afp , washington , january 15 ) the showdown between the united states and north korea has escalated from such peripheral issues as &quot; the axis of evil &quot; to an international crisis , threatening to ruin decades of global efforts at nuclear non-proliferation .
pyongyang declared its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on the 10th of this month , resulting in a stand-off with washington .
analysts said that at present , the global efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation are threatened with failure . the treaty has already been seriously undermined when the non-signatories india and pakistan joined the nuclear club in 1998 .
four days after pyongyang made the above move , five permanent members of the un security council have all taken preventive diplomatic actions on this crisis .
russia said it will send a special envoy to pyongyang to suggest an end to this stalemate , while china proposed that the united states and north korea hold a dialog to reach a compromise .
meanwhile , in london , britain and france are discussing this crisis .
international atomic energy agency has warned that if north korea refuses to abandon its nuclear program , the agency may request the security council to take actions .
as far as russia &apos;s and china &apos;s moves are concerned , many us observers think such talks may force moscow and beijing to decide whether or not to vote against north korea .
other countries with nuclear capabilities , such as iran and libya , will surely be on close watch for the development of north korea crisis .
they would notice that north korea withdraws from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty with impunity , or gets huge sums of funds from the united states in exchange that it stop developing nuclear weapons .
einhorn , a former arms control official of the state department , said : &quot; if north korea is considered capable of withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , they may figure they can make the same move without paying any cost . &quot;
noland from the institute for international economics believes that north korea may have made a tactical mistake because its decision to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty will make the international community more determined than ever to resolve this issue .
japanese court rejects multi-million-yen compensation lawsuit by former chinese slave laborers
( afp , tokyo , january 15 ) a japanese court today rejected a 132 million yen ( 1.1 million us dollars ) compensation lawsuit filed by six chinese who were forced to work as slave laborers in a nickel mine in japan during world war ii .
kyoto district court judge shin kusumoto said that although what the government and nippon yakin kogyo co. did in 1944 jointly was illegal , he rejected this lawsuit based on the civil law that allows a 20-year statute of limitations .
kusumoto said : &quot; the defendants &apos; obligation has expired . &quot;
five former chinese slave laborers , including the 72-year-old liu zonggen and a family member of a deceased slave laborer , have sought unpaid wages , compensations and apologies from the japanese government and nippon yakin kogyo co .
the six people worked as slave laborers for nippon yakin for a period of one year during which they were often beaten up and poorly fed and clad .
nippon yakin argued that the company was in no position to oppose the national policy , while the japanese government , on the other hand , said it has no need to provide compensation to the plaintiffs according to the constitution at that time .
jiji press reported that after the court announced its ruling , liu zonggen said at a press conference : &quot; this is an inhumane ruling . &quot;
he said they will file an appeal .
liu zonggen said : &quot; i &apos;ve got the support from many japanese friends . i &apos;ll fight to the end . &quot;
the plaintiffs &apos; attorney pointed out that this ruling &quot; violates the historical record , &quot; and demanded that the japanese government and nippon yakin pay compensations and offer apologies to resolve the issue .
kyodo news reported that this is the first time such argument has been rejected in lawsuits involving war compensation .
in 1944 , the japanese military abducted about 200 chinese and then sent them to work as slave laborers in oe mountain nickel mine in kaya cho , kyoto prefecture .

( afp , paris ) alcatel , the french telecommunication equipment manufacturing giant hit hard by the downturn in the telecom sector , said that its sales in the fourth quarter of 2002 should show a growth of nearly 30 % over the preceding quarter .

a nominal growth rate of 2.5 % or more will not occur until fiscal 2007 , postponing the original dates by two years .

( afp , sydney , january 18 ) bush fires are ravaging australia , having destroyed nearly 40 homes as of today , and are threatening residential houses in the suburbs around the capital city of canberra . with gusty winds and rising temperatures , the fires are expected to spread further .
australian officials said that according to unconfirmed reports , the blaze that has spread to dozens of suburban towns of canberra and other areas in the act has already left one person dead and several missing .
brown , an officer with the federal police , said that the police are trying to verify the report that at least one person has died in the inferno , but some people have already been confirmed missing .
as strong winds have fanned the bush fires out of control in the northern , southern and western mountainous areas in canberra , the act authorities have declared a state of emergency today for the entire region .

threatened by the bush fires that some officials described as the most devastating in 50 years , rural town residents in the mountainous regions within the snowy mountains in new south wales and kosciuszko national park have all been immediately evacuated .
rural fire service commissioner koperberg said : &quot; it is a serious situation . the snowy mountains may be facing the most serious threat in 50 years . &quot; over a thousand firefighters are fighting a losing battle , unable to prevent the blaze from engulfing the 80,000 hectares of bushland in new south wales .
japanese emperor akihito &apos;s surgery to remove cancerous prostate gland successful
( afp , tokyo , january 18 ) japanese emperor akihito underwent surgery today to have his cancerous prostate gland removed . doctors of the imperial household said the operation went smoothly and the cancer cells didn &apos;t seem to have spread to other organs .
ichiro kanazawa , medical supervisor of the imperial household , said at a press conference held at university of tokyo hospital : &quot; the operation went smoothly as planned and was successfully completed .
his majesty has waked up from anesthesia and had a few words with empress michiko and princess sayako . &quot;
he added : &quot; judging from appearances , we don &apos;t think the ( cancer ) has spread . &quot;
kanazawa said that doctors will perform additional tests to make sure that the cancer is limited to prostate gland only .
the surgery , jointly performed by six doctors , lasted 3 hours and 40 minutes and removed akihito &apos;s entire prostate gland .
the 69-year-old akihito assumed the throne in 1989 , and this is the first time ever that an emperor has undergone an operation at a hospital other than the hospital of the imperial household .
doctors said that akihito is scheduled to recuperate for about a month .
kanazawa indicated as akihito did not bleed much during the operation , the doctors used his own blood for transfusion .
prior to the operation , the doctors stored akihito &apos; blood in advance . the quantity is not specified .
chief cabinet secretary yasuo fukuda said that the government is relieved with the emperor &apos;s successful surgery and hopes for his recovery at the earliest time .
shortly before akihito was admitted to hospital , government officials said , the 42-year-old crown prince naruhito had assumed the emperor &apos;s constitutional duties on a temporary basis .
this is the first time that a japanese emperor has transferred his duties due to hospitalization .
philippines masses troops to combat threats of communist guerrilla
( afp , manila , january 20 ) the philippine security forces are massing various units in order to combat the numerous attacks by the communist guerrilla in some areas of this southeast asian archipelago .
brigadier general purificacion said today that the new people &apos;s army is &quot; attempting to mass troops in some areas , &quot; including the northern philippines , provinces south of manila and some central islands .
he added : &quot; they are intensifying attacks on some areas that they think are weak in military strength , &quot; or &quot; attacking and harassing the troops in scarcely populated areas . &quot;
other officials said that the npa has intensified attacks on the so-called &quot; soft &quot; targets such as telecommunications and power facilities .
last week , the national police chief ebdane required the telecommunications firms to invest hundreds of millions of us dollars in security protection to guard against the npa attacks .
purificacion said : &quot; the armed forces have redeployed more troops in areas most prone to threats . &quot;
purificacion said the number of the npa troops has declined at least 23 % to about 9,000 from 12,000 to 13,000 two years ago .
at least 5,000 of them are &quot; armed regulars , &quot; which were about 6,000 in early 2001 .
he said the government forces repelled them from more than 400 villages where the npa frequented .
he said : &quot; we &apos;re slowly but steadily winning back people &apos;s confidence . &quot;
national security advisor golez said last week that the serious political and military setbacks the npa suffered would force it and its mother organization , the communist party of the philippines , back to the negotiation table .
after the rebels assassinated two philippine legislators , philippine president arroyo ceased negotiations with the communist party in mid 2001 .
last year , the united states included the npa and the cpp in its international blacklist of &quot; foreign terrorist organizations . &quot;
washington , canada , and many western european governments also agreed to track down and stop the foreign funding sources of the rebel troops and freeze their overseas assets .
growth of mobile phone users in mainland china to slow down

north korea claimed that the nuclear stand-off is a bilateral issue involving only the united states , and the intervention of other nations will only make the issue more complicated .

powell : us gets support from over ten allies for its strikes on iraq
( afp , davos , switzerland , january 25 ) us secretary of state powell said that the us plan to attack iraq has got the support of over ten allies .
at this time , he is preparing his speech on the us policy for his attendance at the world economic forum .
under tight security measures , powell arrived at the swiss ski resort of davos to address the annual meeting of the global political and business leaders on sunday .
in the meantime , anti-globalization protesters are also gathering here .
concerns about a possible iraqi war have cast a shadow over this year &apos;s meeting .
the participating opec nations are trying today to ease the concern that the world oil supply may be disrupted once the united states attacks iraq .
powell told reporters who traveled with him to davos for coverage : &quot; quite a number of countries have already indicated ... ( they ) will act with us in unison ; &quot; even if the un security council does not back the war , he added , these countries will not change their stances .

i can name over ten countries just by memory , and i think more countries will show their support . &quot;
us officials said powell will talk respectively with turkish prime minister gul and australian prime minister downer during the meeting in davos .
turkey , the most important nato ally of the united states , is resisting pressure so that it can join the us-led war against iraq .
whereas , the australian government has pledged to send troops to join the war regardless of domestic opposition .
daschle says president bush should come forward with solid proof of hussein &apos;s violations
( afp , washington , january 28 ) senate democratic leader daschle challenged president bush &apos;s way of proving iraq has weapons of mass destruction . he went on to doubt whether the white house has already had a &quot; guiding principle &quot; to prove attacks on husseins are justified .
daschle asked : &quot; if we hold the proof that iraq possesses nuclear and biological weapons , why don &apos;t we show that proof to the world ? - just as president kennedy did 40 years ago when he held the photographs of offensive missiles in cuba and immediately instructed stevenson , the us ambassador to the united nations to announce them at the un general assembly . &quot;
it was during the time when the un arms inspectors were reporting to the un security council on iraqi compliance with arms reduction orders that daschle vehemently assailed president bush in his report at the national press club .
he said : &quot; at a time when we have begun to fight the war on terror , the american people have the right to know why thousands of the us troops are sent to the battlefield at the risk of their lives and why the united states wants to spend billions of dollars , risk offending allies and inflame adversaries to attack iraq . &quot;
daschle said : &quot; in a democratic country , the president should do all he can to clear people &apos;s doubts , which is very important . &quot;
he was referring to the polls that show a decreasing support of the american public for president bush .
white house has been rotating all kinds of reasons to explain the urgency of overthrowing hussein , including its threat to the neighboring countries , poisoning of the kurds , attempt to kill the former president bush , alleged involvement in the sept . 11 attacks , manufacturing weapons of mass destruction and so on , making people wonder which one is to believe .
he said : &quot; it makes people doubt the government has already had a supreme guiding principle . &quot;
parts of northwestern australia devastated by floods
( afp , townsville , australia , january 28 ) while many areas in australia are being ravaged by droughts and forest fires , parts of the remote northwestern region are devastated by floods .
today , disaster relief authorities must send fresh food supplies to burketown in gulf of carpentaria area in queensland . the area has been marooned by floods for nearly three weeks .
burketown has seen frequent flooding and once lost contact with the outside world for months due to floods .
however , the local council chief executive turnour said that this year &apos;s flooding came upon the town all of a sudden .
he said : &quot; no fresh milk , fruits or vegetables ; the supply of bread is also limited . there are only a few foods left in stock before the roads are reopened . &quot;
&quot; the flood came with such suddenness that the last freight truck entering town also got stranded . the truck came into town on the 22nd , and we were cut off from the outside world the very same night . &quot;
turnour said the water level has fallen in the past few days ; if no more rain keeps coming , the roads should become accessible this week .
trad , a bar owner in burketown , said he has been careful to ensure the supply of beers because people , unable to work due to floods , flocked to his bar for drinking .
trad said : &quot; they &apos;re drinking , playing cards and fishing to while away the time . &quot;
&quot; the expanse of water is now replaced by mud . so even if water is receding from the roads , they are still impassable . &quot;
thousands of century-old olive trees to adorn olympic venues in athens
( afp , athens , january 28 ) about 4,000 century-old olive trees will be transplanted to line the 2004 olympic marathon route and other olympic games venues .
these olive trees will be transplanted from the remote islands of crete and zakynthos .
according to the athens olympics organization committee ( athoc ) , these trees would have been uprooted sooner or later anyway due to local construction projects .
athoc said that at present these olive trees are temporarily stored ; 1,500 century-old ones will be replanted in the future along the 42.2-kilometer marathon course .
the rest of the old trees will be planted at other olympic games venues .
olive trees are common of the greek landscape . the shape of the recently unveiled olympic torch is exactly that of an olive leaf as inspired by the tree .
an official from the olympics organization committee said : &quot; this proposal represents the committee &apos;s sensitivity to environmental protection . &quot;
3 million euros will be spent on landscaping along the marathon course .
protesters and people from adjacent communities say the marathon course mars the local environment as some of the roads on the route will be broadened , which will destroy the pristine scenery still unspoiled today .
environmental protesters also complain that many trees have been uprooted in some parts of athens due to the project of the olympic games-related tram route .

russian experts : space shuttle disaster may lead to temporary suspension of iss
( afp , moscow ) a russian space expert pointed out that the tragedy of the us space shuttle columbia &apos;s disintegration on its way back to earth may lead to the temporary suspension of manned missions on the international space station which rely on the us space shuttles and russian spacecraft .
this russian space expert , who did not wish to be named , told the russian media interfax that the accident of columbia &apos;s disintegration on its re-entry of the earth &apos;s atmosphere will force the astronauts on the iss to return to earth and switch the iss to automatic pilot operation for some period of time .
he noted if the age of the space shuttle is confirmed as the cause of the accident , the united states will freeze all space shuttle missions to prevent similar diasters from happening again .
he further pointed out it is very likely that the united states will not send astronauts again to the iss until 2007 or 2008 and must build new spacecraft .
if the us space shuttles stop operation , only russia can send astronauts to the space station by its spacecraft soyuz . however , as the russian space agency is currently having severe financial problems , the united states and russia may reach an agreement to use soyuz to maintain manned missions on the space station while using progress cargo vessels to send supplies to the iss .
according to the russian expert , the astronauts currently at the iss were originally scheduled to take the us space shuttle atlantis back to earth on march 1 and should now be expected to continue their stay at the space station .
the participants of the iss program include 16 countries such as the united states , russia , japan , canada and france .
the russian expert pointed out the tragedy on the 1st illustrated the unreliability of the space shuttle . russia had an accident too in 1971 when a soyuz-11 craft crashed while returning to earth , killing the three astronauts on board .
havel steps down as czech president with new president not yet in sight
( afp , prague , february 2 ) havel , the playwright who became a democracy movement hero during the reign of the czech communist party , said farewell to his public service job today and stepped down from his democratically elected presidential post which he has held for 13 years .
in a televised address , havel thanked the people for their trust in him , saying : &quot; without your understanding and goodwill , i wouldn &apos;t have been able to stay in office for a brief moment . &quot;
although suffering from serious health problems , havel still withstood the great pressure of the top position and stepped down as his term ended even if no successor has yet been chosen .
havel took office on december 29 , 1989 and made his first speech to the public on the balcony of prague castle on the very same day . earlier today he also greeted hundreds of well-wishers on the same spot , saying : &quot; i bid all of you farewell after being your president for 13 years . &quot;
the 66-year-old playwright is a dissident-turned-world-class politician , which itself symbolizes the triumph of democracy over totalitarianism in europe .
after revolution broke out in czechoslovakia , havel , once a prisoner under the communist regime , became the president .
three years later , czechoslovakia split into two countries , the czech republic and slovakia . havel continued to be the president of the czech republic .
today , havel handed over the presidential seal to prime minister spidla and zaoralek , the speaker of the parliament &apos;s lower chamber . they two are scheduled to share the presidential power temporarily starting from tomorrow until a new president is elected .
the czech parliament convened to elect a new president last month , but neither of the voting on january 15 and january 24 yielded any result .
britain expects chirac to eventually support security council resolution authorizing military attacks on iraq
( afp , london , february 3 ) the british government is confident that the french president chirac will eventually support the un security council &apos;s second resolution authorizing military attacks on iraq .
the british media reported today that chirac and the british prime minister blair will meet in le touquet in northern france tomorrow to exchange views on the latest development on the iraqi crisis .
the headline of the left-wing newspaper the guardian reads : &quot; downing street predicts chirac will change stance on iraq . &quot; the guardian also quoted sources from the office of the british prime minister as saying that there are four factors which will influence chirac into accepting the british way of thinking .
the center-right the times also reported , citing british top officials , that chirac has realized his anti-war position has &quot; gone too far , &quot; as he was taken by surprise that seven european countries sided with britain and signed a pro-us letter on the issue of iraq published by the international media last week .
quoting a british diplomat , the times reported that chirac likes to be in the spotlight and to be coaxed with sweet words , but he is far from dumb . it may be too much to expect chirac to make a 180 degree change tomorrow , but it is still hoped that the summit meeting between the two countries may see signs of chirac &apos;s attitude change .
us freezes transfer of nearly 3,000 troops in south korea
( afp , seoul , february 3 ) the us military claimed that the transfer of some 2,900 us officers and soldiers scheduled to leave south korea in the coming three months has been frozen so that the stationed troops can maintain readiness for war .
the freeze on this military order of transfer has no direct links with the nuclear crisis in north korea , but it illustrated the inadequacy of the united states in tackling both iraq and north korea .
the us 8th army stationed in seoul said today that they have received the rotation freeze order to maintain the scale of the us troops in south korea ; while similar military deployments are being carried out near iraq and afghanistan , the suspension of replacement from us-based military units has also been announced .
the us 8th army commander lieutenant general campbell said in a statement that the freeze of transfer order is intended to ensure the us military strength in south korea .
under a defense assistance treaty signed between south korea and the united states , currently some 37,000 us troops are stationed in south korea . the us military in south korea has been on alert ever since north korea &apos;s ambition to develop nuclear programs was disclosed in december last year .
suspected space shuttle debris also spotted in california and arizona in western us
( afp , houston ) nasa said that suspected debris from the disintegrated space shuttle columbia have also been spotted in the states of california and arizona in western united states , which may provide important clues to why the space shuttle broke up in the air .
nasa &apos;s associate administrator kostelnik said : &quot; we have received quite a few reports that debris have been found in california and arizona . &quot;
he said a team of experts has been dispatched to various locations in those states to examine the debris yet pointed out cautiously that so far it is not clear what those pieces are .
dittemore , the space shuttle program manager , said on the 3rd that nasa has formed a special team to search for debris in areas west of texas and louisiana where most of the space shuttle columbia &apos;s wreckage has been found .
dittemore pointed out such debris can be crucial because it may provide the critical missing part about the cause of the accident .
the space shuttle columbia was preparing to land at kennedy space center in florida at 9 : 16 a.m. ( 10 : 16 p.m. taipei time ) on the 1st when it broke up in the air into pieces of burning wreckage . the seven astronauts on board the space shuttle were all killed .
investigators are trying to understand why there was a sharp rise of temperature to as high as 16 degrees celsius on the left side of the space shuttle minutes before the communication broke off while about simultaneously an unusual drag resistance occurred on the left side of the space shuttle , causing the space shuttle to lose control .
kostelnik indicated that the possibility of finding debris in locations farther west than originally expected can be crucial in determining the cause of the accident .
he said : &quot; it &apos;s of critical importance to examine the debris in the early stage of the accident . &quot;
south korea &apos;s special envoy calls for dialogs between us and north korea
( afp , washington , february 4 ) us president bush is faced with strong demands from the next government of south korea and important allies in the us congress to urge washington to hold direct talks with north korea so as to prevent the nuclear crisis from going out of control .
one day after giving the order to have heavy bombers on alert and ready for deployments , which inflamed north korea , bush &apos;s senior aides has to defend washington &apos;s policy toward north korea .
after his talks with secretary of state powell , chyung dai-chul , a special envoy for south korea &apos;s president-elect roh moo-hyun , emphasized south korea &apos;s position , saying : &quot; we hope the united states will play a more active role and have dialogs with north korea . &quot;
he added that dialogs between the united states and north korea should be conducted multilaterally in an international setting .
in the meantime , lugar , the republican senior senator on foreign affairs , also urgently called for the united states to engage in dialogs with north korea .
lugar said : &quot; in my opinion , the us officials should have talks with north korean officials to discuss how to end north korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program through an agreement to a complete international inspection . &quot;
powell &apos;s deputy armitage told lugar &apos;s senate foreign relations committee that the us talks with north korean officials are just a matter of time , not whether to have or not have talks .
armitage said : &quot; of course we &apos;ll have direct talks with north korea ; there &apos;s no question about that . &quot;
however , he said that dialogs will take place only when washington is convinced that a &quot; strong international opinion &quot; in support of ending pyongyang &apos;s nuclear program has been established .
germany &apos;s unemployment rate in january climbs to new high in 5 years
( afp , frankfurt , february 5 ) official statistics show that the bad weather in winter and the prolonged economic downturn have pushed the january unemployment rate in germany to a new high in five years , dealing another heavy blow to german chancellor schroder , who has been just over 100 days into his second term in office .
in addition , the threat of a possible war in iraq further dimmed the economic outlook in germany , the biggest economy in the euro-zone .
it seems likely the hiring freeze in germany &apos;s labor market will continue for months to come .
statistics released by germany &apos;s federal labor office in nuremberg show that the number of people looking for jobs in germany jumped to 4.623 million , or 11.1 % of the german working population . the unemployment rate in january hit a new high of monthly unemployment rate in five year since march 1998 .
last december , the total number of the jobless people reached 4.225 million at an unemployment rate of 10.1 % .
the unemployment in winter months in germany usually increases for seasonal reasons as most of companies , especially those in the construction industry , lay off employees due to bad weather .
however , even after taking this reason into account , the lines for unemployment benefits application last month still continued to grow longer .
seasonally adjusted data released separately by germany &apos;s frankfurt central bank show the total number of the unemployed in january surged to 4.274 million from 4.212 million last december .
meanwhile , the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 10.3 % from 10.1 % .
gerster , the head of the federal labor department , attributed the sharp rise in the number of people looking for work to two factors , the common effect of the winter weather and the poor state of economy .
singapore &apos;s economic review committee : economy expected to fully recover by 2004
( afp , singapore , february 6 ) singapore &apos;s economic review committee said that due to the global geo-political and economic tensions and uncertainties , singapore &apos;s economy will have to wait till 2004 for a full recovery .
singarpore &apos;s erc said in its annual economic review report : &quot; singapore &apos;s economy has not yet completely recovered from the recession in 2001 . the short-term economic prospect in singapore is dimmed by too much instability in the region , the economic slowdown in europe , the united states and japan , the imminent iraqi war and the trememdous challenges from china . &quot;
however , singapore &apos;s economy this year still has reasonable chances of growth , though a full recovery may not be expected until 2004 .
singapore government estimates that following a 2.2 % economic growth rate of last year , this year may see a growth rate of between 2 % to 5 % , though still far below the average annual growth rate of 7.3 % that singapore has enjoyed since 1985 .
erc also recommends that the government defer the restoration of the central provident fund contribution rate for employers and consider no raise of the cpf contribution rate for two years to avoid burdening employers during the current difficult time and to help reduce unemployment rate and send a strong message to foreign investors .

( afp , atlanta , georgia , february 8 ) after signing a contract to advertise for the beverage product gatorade by shooting a commercial with the baseball star jeter and the american football star manning , yao ming , the chinese giant who has become the newest us basketball icon , was met with more than a hundred reporters trying to capture his every word and movement . he could not but feel all this has come too fast though he managed to carry himself amidst such chaos with the composure and wisdom of a confucius .
the 22-year-old huston rockets center will be the starter in the 52nd nba all-star game to be held here tomorrow and become the first asian nba star .
other nba stars such as duncan and iverson all suffered considerable loneliness by comparison with this chinese giant who has drawn the attention of a global crowd of fans .
yao ming said : &quot; the attention i received is obvious . this is only one aspect of the pressure i &apos;ve got . this is something very special .
i wish to stay in my hotel room , but as a basketball player , this might be the luxury i can &apos;t have . &quot;
well , it might be indeed a luxury to wish for when most people can usually only see your tummy at eye level and your face frequently appears in tv commercials .
when you are making money by the millions and replacing air jordan to become the chief pitchman of basketball , your life is inevitably a hustle and bustle .
yao ming said : &quot; all this is happening too rapidly , too fast .
you don &apos;t want to get everything at the very beginning , you want to slowly merge into nba , not like this .
but all this is beyond your control . &quot;

bush vows to disarm iraq one way or the other
( afp , washington , february 14 ) us president bush vowed today to disarm iraqi president hussein &apos;s regime &quot; one way or the other . &quot;
he said : &quot; hussein has weapons of mass destruction , and he has used them . he is used to deceiving the world , and continues to do so .
hussein has also formed ties to terrorist networks . &quot;
in his speech at the fbi headquarters , explaining various kinds of efforts to prevent terrorist attacks such as those on sept . 11 , 2001 , bush sternly declared : &quot; hussein is a danger , and that &apos;s why he shall be disarmed -- one way or the other . &quot;
this is the first public response bush has made to the un security council meeting held today in new york .
the meeting is mainly intended to hear the un arms inspection chief &apos;s report on whether iraq has complied with the un security council resolution 1441 passed on november 8 last year , which orders iraq to disarm .
white house spokesman fleischer said blix hasn &apos;t provided any reason for people to believe that iraq is complying with the security council resolution 1441 .
he told reporters : &quot; today the world hasn &apos;t got any relief from the news coming from new york , convinced that hussein has shown arms inspectors that he is disarming .
the situation is exactly the opposite . &quot;
asked when the united states will propose a follow-up resolution aimed to implement the security council resolution 1441 , fleischer indicated &quot; it &apos;s too early to tell , &quot; but the united states will discuss with its allies on its content and terms .
countries such as france , russia and china still propose tougher arms inspection for iraq instead of a us-led war against iraq .
fleischer noted that president bush also considers military actions as the &quot; last resort . &quot;
however , he insisted on the timetable bush has set , saying that the united nations has got only &quot; a few weeks not months &quot; to test peaceful disarmament with iraq , which will then be followed by military actions .

the report pointed out that these sanctions will include interdicting north korea &apos;s arms shipment and cutting off the channels through which north koreans in japan send money to north korea .
the report pointed out that the pentagon and the state department are working on the detailed plans for sanctions so that the united states can respond promptly any time when north korea takes its new steps to pursue the development of nuclear weapons .
according to the new york times report , the first step will be to urge the un security council , perhaps in the next two weeks , to denounce north korea &apos;s recent measures to develop nuclear weapons such as withdrawing from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and reactivating its frozen nuclear facility at yongbyon that is capable of producing weapons-grade plutonium .
yet , the pacific allies of washington authorities are still opposed to the idea of sanctioning against north korea , while the un security council may still focus on the issue of iraq for the next few weeks .
in the meantime , the new york times report pointed out , many us officials are concerned if the united states launches attacks against iraq , north korea may use the opportunity to promote its weapons production .

us-south korean military exercise to be held in march ; north korea threatens to quit armistice agreement
( afp , seoul , february 18 ) south korea and the united states are going to conduct a large-scale military exercise starting from early march , that will last nearly a month . north korea , in response , threatens to quit the armistice agreement that ended the korean war .
at a time when the tensions caused by the nuclear stand-off on the korean peninsula have continued for four months and showed no sign of easing off , north korea &apos;s threat to quit the armistice agreement can be generally interpreted as pyongyang authorities &apos; response to the announcement made by the united states and south korea yesterday of the joint military exercise to be held in march .
the statement issued by the north korean military accuses the united states of repeatedly violating the armistice agreement : &quot; if the us side continues violating and misusing the armistice agreement as it pleases , there will be no need for north korea to remain bound to the armistice agreement uncomfortably .
the future development will depend entirely on the us attitude . &quot;
however , the us top military officials said that north korea had said they would no longer be bound to the armistice agreement as early as in 1994 .
us authorities announced yesterday that the united states and south korea will hold their annual joint military exercise on the korean peninsula from march 4 to april 2 .
a south korean government official said that south korea issued an invitation to north korea yesterday , asking them to send observers to watch this military exercise .
the official , who did not want to be named , said : &quot; north korea &apos;s statement to quit the armistice agreement is obviously a response to the upcoming joint military exercise by the united states and south korea . &quot;
earlier , the united states ordered 12 b-52 bombers and the same number of b-1 bombers to get ready to go to areas around the korean peninsula . north korea strongly denounced this move .
in addition , the japanese media reported yesterday that the united states has planned to step up its military deployment in northeast asia in order to guard against the concerns triggered by north korea &apos;s nuclear weapons program .
indonesian authorities reject proposal to increase security protection of us embassy
( afp , jakarta , february 19 ) the us embassy in jakarta proposed to indonesian authorities that a 3-meter-high surrounding wall be built to increase the security of the embassy , but the proposal was rejected .
&quot; the jakarta post &quot; and the state-owned &quot; antala &quot; news agency both reported today that jakarta authorities rejected this proposal to build a wall to replace the fence that now separates the embassy and the residences from the outside on grounds that it is aesthetically unacceptable .
jakarta officials , quoting mayor sutiyoso , pointed out that the wall can be built , provided that it be built five meters away from the existing fence inside the embassy compound .
in addition , the embassy must put sod and plant flowers in between the two fences to improve the look of the embassy compound .
sutiyoso indicated that landscaping can reduce the feeling of the us embassy as a citadel .
since around the time the united states led the military actions in afghanistan aimed to overthrow the taliban regime in 2001 , its embassy in indonesia has been endlessly confronted with protesting activities .
that year , when the former ambassador protested against the jakarta police for failing to effectively stop the threat from the hardline islamic groups on the safety of the americans , the relevant authorities increased the security protection of the embassy .
it is generally expected that large-scale protests will become inevitable if the united states launches military actions against iraq .

study shows father &apos;s genes may affect timing of birth
( afp , paris , february 28 ) according to a report of a danish study to be published on saturday &apos;s &quot; british medical journal , &quot; a father &apos;s genes may affect the timing of a child &apos;s birth .
about 5 % of pregnant women go past their term , with a gestational length of 294 days .
at present , this problem is known to have effects on the health of both mother and child , but what causes it remains a mystery .
the danish researchers tracked 43,000 cases of birth from 1980 to 1992 . the targeted women have at least two children and had a post-term pregnancy for the first delivery .
only the data of their first two deliveries are used for analysis .
overall , of those women who had a prolonged pregnancy for the first delivery , nearly 20 % had the same experience for their second pregnancy .
however , when the first and the second child had different fathers , the rate dropped to just a little bit over 15 % .
olesen , the lead author of the research report , told afp : &quot; this is already a lot .
this means if you ( with the second child ) have the same partner , then compared with those who change their partners , your chance of having a prolonged pregnancy will be over 30 % . &quot;
the research report said : &quot; if a woman changes her partner every time she gets pregnant , it may reduce the risk of reoccurrence of post-term delivery .
we believe this is a new finding .
but the result means the timing of birth may be decided by a father &apos;s genes . &quot;

bobetko was hospitalized for treatment in the middle of last november .
racan , the prime minister of croatia , once promised him that he will not be extradited to the hague tribunal while he is hospitalized .
a spokesperson for the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia issued a statement on september 20 last year , saying that the tribunal had officially demanded that the croatian government arrest and extradite bobetko , who committed &quot; crimes against humanity and war crimes . &quot;
bobetko served as the croatian army chief of staff from november 1992 to july 1995 .

us defense department calls off 2 missile intercept tests
xinhua news agency , washington , january 8 ( reporter tan xinmu ) lehner , spokesman for the missile defense agency at the pentagon , announced on the 8th that the us military authorities have decided to call off the two missile intercept tests scheduled for the first half of this year because the development of a new type of booster that launches the interceptor is behind the original schedule .
lehner told the media here that the missile defense agency this year will need to concentrate on solving the problem of the booster and that the next missile intercept test will be conducted after boeing manufactures the new type of booster this fall .
boeing originally planned to begin flight tests in 2000 on the new booster that carries the missile &quot; interceptor , &quot; but the tests were postponed due to technical reasons .
after the failure to launch the booster in december 2001 , boeing decided to redesign it and planned to complete the design by this fall .
in the previous eight ground-based missile intercept tests , the us military used a modified &quot; minuteman &quot; rocket as a surrogate booster , but the results of the tests on this kind of booster were not satisfactory .
the missile intercept tests conducted in july 2000 and last december were not successful because the &quot; interceptor &quot; failed to separate from the booster .
us president bush ordered the pentagon to start planning a missile defense system on december 17 last year and try to set up a preliminary missile defense system by september 2004 .
however , many experts think as far as technologies are concerned , the time is not yet ripe to set up a missile defense system .
kadish , director of the missile defense agency , also indicated that if boeing fails to manufacture the desired booster as scheduled , the entire missile defense system set-up will be affected .

xinhua news agency , riyadh , january 22 according to saudi newspaper al-watan that quoted algerian minister of energy and mines khelil on the 22nd , in the event of a war in iraq , there is no guarantee that opec can make up for the shortfall of 5 million barrels of crude oil each day on the international market .
khelil said that among the opec member states , only saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have the actual spare capacity to increase production .
he believed , &quot; opec will have problems meeting the market needs , because even if saudi arabia and the uae have the spare capacity to increase production , they can increase 3 million barrels per day at most . &quot;
since december last year , the price of crude oil on the international market has kept rising due to the general strike in venezuela and the threat of war in iraq .
on the 12th , opec decided in vienna to increase the daily oil production by 1.5 million barrels starting from february .
however , as the threat of war in iraq still looms large , and britain and the united states continue to build up troops in the gulf region , the oil price on the international market continued to rise on the 21st .
khelil said that the international oil price is now more being driven by the tensions of the international political situation rather than supply and demand mechanism .
shenzhen luohu customs cracks down on currency smuggling
xinhua news agency , shenzhen , january 25 ( li nanling and li xiangzhi ) shenzhen luohu customs , while ensuring a civilized and efficient inspection , spared no mercy in cracking down on the smuggling of currency by means of evading travelers &apos; inspection .

as the largest port for travelers &apos; inspection in the country , luohu customs is responsible for overseeing a daily flow of over 250,000 travelers . if the relatively common practice of carrying cash beyond the legal limit were not strictly regulated , each day might see a considerable amount of capital flight .
in face of this situation , the customs has always taken tight monitoring measures such as frequent checks and careful inspection so as to effectively prevent the outflow of domestic currencies .
a little past 9 a.m. on february 19 last year , a middle-aged woman who walked quickly towing a suitcase caught the attention of the customs officers .
after the luggage went through the machine , the officers found the suitcase contained suspicious objects and opened it for inspection . they were surprised to see three large bundles of hong kong currencies in 1,000-hk-dollar denomination packed in black plastic bags totaling 3 million hk dollars .
this was the largest case of a traveler carrying excess cash abroad the customs has uncovered in nearly two years .
in july and august last year , taking advantage of a larger outflow of travelers during the summertime and the crowded site due to the remodeling of the port facility , some overseas &quot; underground money houses &quot; attempted to smuggle a large quantity of foreign currencies out of the country .
the customs took this matter seriously and made key deployments there to effectively crack down on the foreign exchange smuggling by the &quot; underground money houses . &quot;
from july 2 to august 1 , luohu customs uncovered a total of 4 cases of foreign currency smuggling by the &quot; underground money houses , &quot; involving an equivalent of more than 1.46 million yuan .

( international ) us personal consumption expenditures flat last year
xinhua news agency , washington , january 31 ( reporter wang zhenhua ) a report released by the us department of commerce on the 31st shows that although the us personal consumption showed a relatively brisk growth last december , the annual growth rate only broke even with that in 2001 when economy was in recession .
during the last month of last year , personal consumption expenditures , the major driving force for the growth of the us economy , increased 0.9 % , the strongest monthly growth since july last year .
spending on durables rose 6.1 % , while spending on non-durables and services only increased 0.2 % .
this was a clear sign of slow sales in an otherwise busy holiday shopping season in the united states .
in the last quarter of last year , personal consumption expenditures , which account for about two thirds of the us gdp , rose only 1 % , significantly lower than the 4.2 % growth rate in the third quarter . this is the quarter with the smallest growth since the first quarter of 1993 .
economic analysts think uncertain factors such as a possible us war on iraq , the sharp decline in the stock market and a stagnant job market have mainly held back consumers from spending and consequently led to a sharp slowdown in the us economy in the fourth quarter .
for the entire year last year , us personal consumption expenditures grew 4.5 % , matching the growth rate in 2001 .
the report also shows that the us personal income rose 0.4 % last december .
the annual increase of us personal income last year was 3 % , down from the 3.3 % increase rate in 2001 .
with spending growth outpacing income , the us savings rate dropped from 4.5 % in november to 4.1 % at the end of the year .

since west african leaders again held talks in senegal on the civil war in cote d &apos;ivoire , the turmoil in cote d &apos;ivoire has escalated .
seydou diarra , who is vastly respected in ivoirian politics , was nominated as the new prime minister at the meeting and will return to the country on the 31st to start forming a coalition government .
however , the &quot; young patriots , &quot; an organization that supports ivoirian president gbagbo , resents representatives of rebels taking up such key posts as defense and interior ministers in the future government .
they accused france of coercing gbagbo into accepting the plan to form the coalition government and called diarra &quot; prime minister for the french , &quot; threatening that death is waiting for diarra .
according to reports , although the runways at abidjan airport have been cleared , several hundred members of &quot; young patriots &quot; are staying in the waiting room , ready to boycott the return of diarra .

xinhua news agency , ottawa , february 3 ( reporter hu guangyao ) according to the local media reports on the 3rd , the plans of two canadian astronauts to go to space on the us spacecraft in may and november of this year will have to be scrapped due to the accident of the us space shuttle columbia .
garneau , canada &apos;s first astronaut and president of the canadian space agency , said that the us investigation of the columbia accident may hinder the planned missions of the international space station ; some of the programs may have to be postponed or even canceled .
the canadian astronauts , maclean and williams , were originally scheduled to take their space flights respectively in may and november this year .
the two people are currently receiving training in houston , usa .
during the 1990s , three canadian astronauts participated in space missions on the space shuttle columbia .
garneau also disclosed that the space science experiments aboard columbia this time included two research projects sponsored by canada .
the research projects involve the protein crystal growth with one of the objectives being the treatment of breast cancer and prostate cancer .

( international ) us construction spending posted a sharp rise last december
xinhua news agency , washington , february 3 ( reporter he ying ) the us department of commerce issued a report on the 3rd , stating that the construction spending in the united states last december rose 1.2 % over november to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 858.3 billion us dollars .
the report said spending on residential construction last december reached 434.6 billion us dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment , up 2.9 % over november .
analysts think that the low interest rate is a key factor for the robust growth in residential construction .
currently , the us federal reserve still keeps the short-term interest rate at 1.2 % , the lowest level in 41 years .
however , in contrast with the residential construction , the commercial construction spending in the united states last december was 158.6 billion us dollars on an annualized basis after a seasonal adjustment , down 1.9 % from november .
analysts think that given the current uncertainties about the economic prospect of the united states , businesses are reluctant to increase their investment in building factories and other facilities .
in addition , concerns about terrorist attacks have also adversely affected the commercial construction activities . although bush signed the terrorism insurance act in november last year , it is not sufficient to dispel investors &apos; worries .
for the entire year last year , the growth rate of the us residential construction spending went down from the 2.7 % in 2001 to 0.4 % , the lowest level since 1991 .

( international ) studies find preemies &apos; learning disabilities surmountable
xinhua news agency , washington , february 15 low birth-weight preemies are generally slow in their mental development and may easily encounter learning disabilities .
researchers at yale university in the united states recently found that this kind of learning disabilities can be surmounted as preemies grow older .
studies confirm that the neurological system of preemies with birth weight lower than 1,500 gram is prone to problems . as many as 50 % of such preemies need special care while attending school .
although many earlier experiments show that animals can recover from initial brain damages , there haven &apos;t been any related reports of preemies &apos; recovery from brain damage .
according to the media report here , researchers at yale university have tracked and monitored 300 children born prematurely and given them iq tests when they were at ages of 3 , 4 1 / 2 , 6 , and 8 . most of them are found to continuously gain their learning abilities as time passes .
tests show that of the preemies classified as &quot; mentally retarded &quot; at the age of 3 , half have reached the average level in verbal comprehension and iq tests after five years .

researchers said one of the key factors in the mental development of preemies lies in the family environment .
children who are from a family of three and whose mothers had high levels of education scored better in iq tests .

( international ) austrian researchers discover spinal marrow cells that trigger chronic pain
xinhua news agency , vienna , february 20 ( reporter lin chuan ) researchers at vienna university in austria found in human spinal marrow a group of neurological cells that have long lasting memory and will become highly agitated the moment they are slightly stimulated by pain . this is another step forward in finding the cause of chronic pain .
chronic pain sufferers are hypersensitive to pain and eventually have to live with pain in their daily life .
however , what causes the disorder has so far remained virtually unknown .
according to the report by austrian news agency , the research team led by jürgen sandkühler , head of neurophysiology department at the brain research institute , vienna university , found while doing a biopsy on tissue slices that some spinal marrow cells exhibiting no unusual behavior under normal condition show agitation when stimulated by pain .
the reaction increases as the pain stimuli intensifies .
however , different from other neurons , this group of spinal marrow cells subsequently become oversensitive to pain stimuli and respond dramatically to even minuscule pain stimuli .
researchers also found that there is a special pathway in spinal marrow cells . when the cells are stimulated , these pathways will open up to allow in calcium ions , thus setting off a further chain reaction .
according to sandkühler , the reason why chronic pain sufferers are sensitive to even slight pain is that this type of spinal marrow cells have a long-lasting memory which retains &quot; traces of pain . &quot;
he noted that this finding can put people on track to search for ways of erasing this memory .
