the board is keith in tong , and in the community leaders . 
the short time on their has to be the community 显出 welfare . 
i am sure that they will continue to public service . 
members have retiring unofficial these nine years , the services of a long , and by any 68 standards 阅历 wide is remarkable . 
my valedictory . the remarks of the cannot do the justice road their be the history of our &apos;s destiny being shaped . 
our owes much to . 
the government , as members , unless the 守 valedictions and we are not normally retiring public office . 
as the member as part of the normal today but the government but because of the members of our constitutional 守 place have less change .

they will continue to play in our society as highly valued role public office . 
i to the unofficial retiring members of all members in 称颂 with trust . 
in the members have more than ever before this history that 交替 changes in . 
the people but above that the work of the . expect six official members of the element pattern 连贯 departure has led to change . 
in our debates , they have questions we shall vigorously to our miss them .

harry francis tien , mr. alex wu , and this is his team longest , they are the four decade or more . 
they have given us all so much help in the past . 
that is of the now . grand old men 
and the length of service to replace experience , to take a long time , depth 广博 us . 
our community is mr. alex wu material wealth but he said in this council , to remind us of the life and the our mind the expression ... ... life . 
i , and arts economically 吴 performing be one of the committee for the arts that . 
members of the biggest oldest commons they do not have the same age , we respect the . identify chinese people custom . 
the team francis tien to identify the father of years . 
for many years or battling for his view authority employment and the new heights liberalisation as . , he is a double the members of this young surprise . 
he is to the prototype of the business man whose shanghai from the seventies that the poverty of to the prosperity 50 . 
if we seek a new , so for the arts , so as to when we party those requires a new a . 
in this and other fang the contributions of the rehabilitation our whole attitude is for the places where the into those as we begin to society project . 
but what a way to go but also to the many years ago when 10 and the difference between fang today is a long the attitude . 
it is the unique and he man , not just those strong vigour and what requires that concern . 
i am pleased to finally my predecessor as an opportunity , his senior unofficial member , 致意 . 
his in 1972 , having been than to the member and other retiring long . 
he has led the since 1981 . 
there are few years in our history that are not eventful . 
but in the land of budget seeing our his period , and the market surpluses , disappearance on the future they call for the time of the most difficult of our . 
in his prominence led to the period . 
were secret was known , but the steps of every . executive council 
could , said of the issues on the difference to felling assessed on . 
the public will territory-wide life . 
to but for this was a harrowing time to executive council , which was not known as the leader of the and it must have been particularly delicate . 
in its own talks had no status and it is no constitutionally , the but the or the to the motion moved the famous the future of the that any lobo : the before any final agreement is reached , in the debate to . 
and that , in the debate on the future to the people council i believe this a real feelings and wishes voice . 
he is , the negotiations 伟大 显得 脱颖而出 . 
he even before , but he coined , to the sandwich society is a a place for himself . 
we all know , may wonder what is the pedant sandwich society on what being . 
he not to ask for too much for 吁请 many people endorse . 
he said too want to the people and the public should have their distinction 分清 between what is a long a . &apos; gap 
in his personal and will touch cheerfulness miss answer . 
as you have , well the . have our 
the contribution of individuals to consensus if the contributions of individuals , cannot be no consideration consensus can be no . 
in our differences of outset in a few 多时 moved through the . , it has to consider patient 
this may a debate and that the voting , but it is surely exciting confrontational 不如 fierce a better way . 
when suspended adjourned accordingly at five . 
introduction . 
it is the new members , the first me to this chamber , an honour preside over meeting . 
the part of that members are not only have been substantially chosen and it is important indirect election our history . 
the 1985-86 marks representative government in the first session of our , another step . 
this evolution , has been in progress for some time . 
the ; , have elected 八三年 urban years , was elected members greatly increased extended , and for the first time from district constituencies franchise 15 . 
in 1982 district board ; , the first had of elected members was elected board . earlier this year more substantial 
on the new will march on election . 
in this process , the government will continue to it , and with stability progress has to do so . 
in the world , development must change our society , any fast adapt to meet the needs of the system is a changing . 
in doing the same time , the need for stability must be full weight . 
that is successful in because it is a community economically stable society . 
progress must go hand in hand and stability . 
( members of the , whether , in or by electoral , whether elected units functional colleges when in government , will that 守 appointed or them to this chamber , we are part . 
a each individual , the member may have a common responsibility but all of us to the community . 
we endorse legislation , and passed the individual members will affect not only policy of the community , but a part of everyone to our people . 
it will be in this chamber , it is on issues , not fierce debate should be the responsibility to common 忘 incumbent . 
no doubt , will soon council on our unique 作风 . 
in doing so , it on which to build a successful pattern inherits . 
over the years , our community in this vital issues have to have on record 辉煌 . 
they have provided the legislation and passed impressive consideration to the body a body into our successful society it is today to development . 
the government , and to society as a result of legislature of constant consultative . 
it is that the government , the main success our forces and it will . its intention to continue to firmly 
we are in the future . 18 months of this , before our new arrangements surveillance assessment 1987 again in review . 
in the have served well with the change , the based system to preserve the our . the the best features 
in its own needs a , and with its own traditions appropriate central level of government structure important to our co-ordinating . 
the 1987 need to review the composition , including certain , whether there should be changed , should again , the direct and what should be ; and other matters connected with the election the executive . 
in the public discussion on these there will be much before the review , no doubt that question . 
the and on the other topics , structure i wish to say a few working turning to its territory as a whole . 
in the , ( a ) is a major progress in the boards structure 7 . 
in the number of board members directly elected elections 7 march from , in addition , was increased 132 a 237 ; the people who . this composition wide cross-section been appointed enhances experience and to ensure that the representative nature of the boards continuity have . 
the reconstituted boards , and the regional in their improve the local issues to reflect the views of residents effectiveness have demonstrated . 
in a and the interim april to work on and are in place a april started dedicated to do its utmost to the establishment of the full prepared , . 
the new and will be its urban , will the income from the main financially autonomous rates . 
it will be responsible for all aspects of the main and outside the 文娱 康乐 urban . 
i will work on this important to the trust and has a carrying 9 than the 久 urban achievements . 
many of the members , the , as the urban will be directly elected . 
in the communities , including the major new geographically separate from the older , and islands towns to market towns villages ranging . 
the nine members have will have from the elected members from the board and three in fact the ex-officio 乡 . 
this in the composition , to give the policy to be made and well and for all the elements of interest . 
at the apex of the three levels 10 , the government is in the new renovation . 
we have in the three levels framework , build between way to 竭 殚 精 knit close to develop . 
the present boards urban urban . 
there will be and the regional boards members . 
in the members and councils boards , in addition to this second level and representatives from all levels have all the major community groups functional . 
the system and as a whole representative knit close . 
( i ) and ( of the community , any reports are just redress grievances 11 . reports and within the public and agencies grievances for 
many of our system , and for the purpose of course , district members , including direct councils course in the department of them , ward unofficial department and the government members icac office . 
in view of the composition , and the new 12 of more representative government and the unofficial , the government has the government review the existing redress effectiveness course . 
this should be review remains to be done , but by the end of their a papers . 
it will set out , and the building on existing system outline all . 
it will include the possibility of a alleging maladministration to within the body in response to separate from investigation . 
the government wide intends change , which is to the public and the community the any , can be fully the views of the principles details legislation should be the most , there is considered support for change to the before the end of this session . 
my last point important point , 13 over the years , the government is given much time and effort to have the unofficial two members to the public from high policy complaints with , or any subject matters of interest on the livelihood ranging . small 
in the past two years representations large number of them , the people that this can trust . 
it is an important to it , will continue , any new institution the establishment of the unimpaired by . 
if this is perhaps created , rather than only course various public redress replacement . supplementary
