please listen to the detailed report now by ma kaiyue .
democratic party senators lygoman and klee of american state department made a statement on tuesday in buenos aires to urge clinton government to approve the protocol reached in tokyo meeting within this week .
both senators indicated that this would make american representatives more convincing for developing countries to make commitment easily for reducing the emission of warm house effect waste gas .
this was in fact a necessary condition in several proposals put forward before by senate .
however , some u.s. house representatives in buenos aires said they had an objection to any similar action of clinton government like this .
sensenbluna , republican party house representative from wisconsin and chairman of science team committee of house of representative , said that there was a fatal defect in kyoto protocol that would be surely denied by u.s. senate and the state department .
he said : &quot;
just like the protocol was laid aside at present . it was already dead when presented to the senate . u.s. senate and the state department would not approve it .
the question is what we can do now .
try to remedy , or just declare the fatal defect of this protocol ? we shall discuss again . &quot;
house representative sensenbluna added : &quot; this is not a party dispute between two parties in house of representative and senate of the capital hill . &quot;
democratic party house representative clinck from pennsylvania said that he opposed this protocol because it would cut down job opportunities , and like he mentioned , the reduction of the industrialization degree of u.s ..
however , kuchenki , democratic party house representative from ohio , disagreed sensenbluna &apos;s point of view , and did a comparison between fighting against the global warming and striving for world peace .
he said that the same determination would make tokyo protocol win .
he said :
house representative kuchenki said : &quot; i hope that this progress will go on . at the same time , we should not ignore the necessity of reaching a global resolution because of a certain senator &apos;s temporary persistence , no matter with or without participating of u.s. state department . &quot;
in the main meeting hall in buenos aires , representatives are discussing all kinds of issues ; some of them certainly will be remained for 160 ministers of energy and environment from participating countries on wednesday &apos;s meeting .
the representatives from u.s. said , in spite of the fact that some issues concerned by u.s. state department might be postponed to next annual meeting for solution , this meeting has got some progress .

the london headquartered human right organization &quot; tibet information network &quot; announced that one of the most respectful religion leaders , agya rinpoche , had escaped to u.s. to protest china &apos;s policy towards tibet .
&quot; tibet information network &quot; said , agya rinpoche seemed angry to china &apos;s attempt of temple reformation in troublous tibet area and refused to accept the reincarnation of panchen lama who was appointed by dalai lama .
but &quot; tibet information network &quot; said , it was not sure now if agya rinpoche would seek asylum in u.s.
a u.s. arms control delegation , that is going to beijing to discuss china &apos;s joining missile technology control agreement as early as possible , thinks that china is possibly still exporting her missile technology to other countries .
now , please listen to the integral report of voa correspondent fang yuan .
a team of american officials headed by holem , u.s. acting under secretary of state , of american department of state , held negotiation on china &apos;s joining of missile technology control agreement with chinese foreign minister , tang jiaxuan , deputy chief of the general staff of chinese army , xion guangkai , and other chinese arms control specialists . this negotiation lasted for one and half a day .
the negotiation focused on how to realize chinese president jiang zemin &apos;s expression made during president clinton &apos;s visit to china in june this year .
at that time , jiang zemin indicated that china would consider joining missile technology control agreement , and this was viewed as one of the major fruits of u.s. china summit meeting .
a member of u.s. delegation denoted to associated press , that american side doubts if china still exports missile components and parts or missile technologies at present , while pakistan and iran are two beneficiary countries of china &apos;s exporting missile technologies .
this official said u.s. side would keep on raising this issue to china and , he believed that china was also taking measures to solve these questions .
china &apos;s exporting of missile technology is always an issue of friction between u.s. and china relations .
since the nuclear tests performed by india and pakistan , two old enemies on south asia subcontinent , in succession during the first half of this year , u.s. has been particularly felt that it is necessary for china to make commitment on controlling of missile technical transfer . because pakistan , one of the two nuclear race opponents on south asia subcontinent , is china &apos;s long-term allied country .
as early in 1993 , u.s. exerted economic sanction on china due to china &apos;s exporting missile components and technology to pakistan . u.s. did not cancel the sanction to china until 1994 when china guaranteed to stop exporting ground-to-ground missile .
u.s. is also worrying about the missile deal between china and iran that will constitute a serious intimidation to america &apos;s allied countries in middle east and u.s. benefit .
but the u.s. official who revealed above information would not like to give detailed explanation for what kind of missile technology china provided to pakistan and iran and when did china do so .
he said there is no enough evidence at present to support the conclusion that china exported missile technology to these two countries for sure .
every time when u.s. got evidence that indicating china &apos;s exporting of missile technology to these two countries before , china would always either deny it or say that the technology was so called dual-purpose technology , and the technology she exported was for peaceful purpose only .
chinese side has not made any public response so far to american delegation official &apos;s speech .
according to another report of associated press from beijing , washington has confirmed the country that helped pakistan to do r &amp; d and launch korean type missile in april was north korea instead of china .
above is the integral report of voa correspondent fang yuan .
from the meteorological information , we knew the results caused by el nino phenomena last year , including continual violent fire in indonesia , the deluge-flooded desert in peru , and serious abnormal climate in wide areas all around the world .
in america , at the beginning of this year , the flood attacked california and many states in southern area , and then drought hit many places in southern parts .
according to meteorological specialists , the el nino is changing into another new phenomenon called la nina .
and next year , la nina will have a frightening behavior at least as strong as el nino .
now , please listen to a report of voa correspondent li lan from chicago and read by qi zhifen .
last winter , it was much warmer than those usually freezing winters in chicago and with less snow , and it could be very similar next winter .
at the same time , el nino swept fiercely in southeast asia , the rainfall greatly reduced and the drought resulted in a prairie fire burning for several weeks out of control .
both el nino and la nina are the result of a considerable temperature change in surface water in east pacific ocean in the tropics .
el nino means the temperature of surface water in the ocean is much higher than usual , it will affect air current situation , and in turn it will change the climate in different regions in the world .
while la nina means the temperature of surface water in the ocean is much lower than usual , and its influence on many regional climate is just contrary to el nino .
the climate specialist , lavo , of u.s. national bureau of meteorology said that the big fire in indonesia next year wouldn &apos;t be out of control because it was estimated that the rainfall in this area from december this year to march next year would be more than that in past years .
meanwhile , the temperature in west and southeast africa will be a little lower than normal time , and rainfall in northern part of south america will be more .
the southern part of america will be drier than usual . it means there could be a lasting drought in texas and new mexico , and the possibility of big forest fire in florida will be higher than normal .
all the rainstorms in california and southern region this year were imputed to el nino .
lavo said that the el nino won &apos;t produce rainstorm itself , but it will offer conditions of forming the serious rainstorm .
this summer is one of the hottest summers in u.s.
somebody connect global warming to el nino phenomena .
lavo thinks it is possible , but has not been confirmed so far .
but whatever the other reason is , it means the coming winter in north and middle west part of u.s. will be a much colder winter , a winter with more snow .

a report of ottawa citizen newspaper said , canadian federal international trade minister marchi made this remark when attending a meeting on foreign affair and international trade on thursday in ottawa .
marchi said , both the local situation he saw during his participating in apec summit conference in malaysia not long ago , and china &apos;s arrest of persons with different political view in recent days made him believe firmly that canada should export her values simultaneously with her products , no matter in offering economic aid or handling international trade .
the human right and social justice should be an important part in canadian foreign trade policy .
according to canadian press , the report of foreign affair committee of canadian senate suggested that canadian government should re-examine and verify all the foreign aid projects , and strive to improve local human right status simultaneously when the economy of aid receiving countries develops .
a report of national post newspaper said , all signs indicated that canadian government was trying to regulate her policy towards asian countries including china , and the report of foreign affair committee of senate was just one of those signs .

moreover , for these , the man who bring these to them plays a role of good sample , to improve local human right , to improve directly the labor right , have , will have very direct affect .

sheng huaren , chief of china state economic and trade commission indicates that chinese army and other government departments will be completely separated from the domination to their subordinate enterprises and companies in a near future .
although chinese government ever released several similar directives , the determination of this action seems much stronger .
now , please listen to the report of voa correspondent nin xin .
sheng huaren , chief of china state economic and trade commission indicates that chinese army will be completely separated from the domination to their subordinate enterprises and companies before december 20 .
other party , government , and judicatory departments must take similar action at the beginning of next year .
chinese president jiang zemin commanded in july this year that , army , and armed police must stop running enterprises , hotels , and other commercial establishments so that to control the wide spread corruption and smuggling within the army .
sheng huaren indicated that , up to now , some enterprises dominated by army in shanghai and tianjin have been shifted to be under the leadership of local government . but he does not explain if the army will be compensated .
not only the army must hand over their control of the subordinate enterprises , party , government , and judicatory departments will never manage their attached state-owned enterprises as well .
there are more than 100 million employees in chinese state-owned enterprises , due to serious bad debts , dead debts , and a weakened export market resulted from global economic crises etc , many state-owned enterprises are at the brink of bankruptcy .
sheng huaren said , the employee numbers on roll book in many existing state-owned enterprises are over ten times as many as what these enterprises actually need , that makes those enterprises in a worse loss situation .
this shows that enhancement of market competition power of state-owned enterprises has been a very urgent affair .
on the other hand , the analysts indicate that the corruption and poor management widely exist in government and judicatory departments who administrate the state-owned enterprises .
the most common conditions are that many government officials who administrate an industry also take charge of the enterprises in the same industry .
therefore , they are able to take full advantage of their right or power to offer preferential conditions on contracts , loans , and taxes to these enterprises .
these phenomena ruined the fair market competition ; in turn it obstructed china &apos;s transformation of from planned economy to market economy .
it is understood that , over 500 largest state-owned enterprises originally attached to the party , government , and judicatory departments will be supervised by a newly established commission under the state council , and the employees of these enterprises will be arranged by personal departments .
the smaller enterprises will be administrated by the local government .
and the financial and investment companies will be administrated and controlled unitarily by ministry of finance .
at present , it is not sure if the transformation means the country will reduce the loans to state-owned enterprises and make them gradually go bankrupt .
some analysts think that because a high unemployment rate may cause social turbulence , china will solve the loss problem of state-owned enterprises in the way of merger instead of bankruptcy .

then , bush imposed 37 % anti-dump tax upon some timber from canada for reason that the canadian government offered subsidies to the export of this kind of timber and thus was dumping the product to the us market .
shorter said , that the us federal government would increase the subsidies to some agricultural products by 80 % according to the newly issued &quot; agriculture act &quot; moreover . this kind of practice is completely against the promise that the us made in the trade negotiations in the qatari capital of doha last november .
at the doha meeting , the us insisted free trade in the agricultural trade to assist the agricultural products of poor countries to enter the market of wealthy countries .
in return , it would be easier for the advanced countries to sell their products and services to poor countries .

according to relevant stipulations , if eu is to levy retaliatory tariff on us products , it must formally notify wto of the relative punishment measures before 18th this month .
the us government &apos;s declaration to impose 30 % tariff on imported steel products this march aroused great dissatisfaction from steel exporting countries . as one of the big victims , eu &apos;s reaction was especially strong .
eu has urged us to lift the high tariff on steel import , or to make trade compensation for this .
however , eu is working along both lines . while it sues to wto , it also sets out a list of us goods subject to retaliatory tariff , such as fruit juice and textile products .
wto designated an expert team earlier this month to carry out investigations on steel trade dispute between eu and us .
on 7th this month , the us government announced the exemption of high tariff on 61 types of imported steel products and said a list of more products free from high tariff is under way .
analysts here pointed out that eu &apos;s notification of retaliatory trade measures to wto is a further step of bringing pressure to the us government , forcing us to make more concessions in the eu-us steel trade dispute .
