as for myself , as for china , i sincerely look forward that sino-us relations can build on top of the foundation of the three sino-us joint communiques and the joint declaration by the leaders of the two countries this time ; continue to progress forward steadily and with substance .

the taiwan problem has been the most sensitive issue affecting sino-us relations and that is a reality of life .

the delegates continue their works at the united nations global climate talks in buenos aires , capital of argentina
meanwhile , u.s. congress is also debating whether last year &apos;s kyoto ( japan ) agreement is to be approved or not .
another report from voice of america &apos;s correspondent in buenos aires : on tuesday , several members of u.s. congress brought the kyoto debate to the meeting hall in buenos aires .
please listen to the details of the story . ma kaiyue is making news this hour .
on tuesday , u.s. congress , democratic sen. lieberman and kerry made a statement in buenos aires . they will urge the clinton administration to sign and approve the accord arrived at the kyoto meeting this week .
both senators indicated that the approval could enhance the persuasiveness of u.s. delegates and cause developing countries to make a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
this is actually the essential condition brought up in the past several bills by the senate .
nevertheless , some house representatives in buenos aires said that they are in opposition of any approval by the clinton administration .
the republican house science committee chairman james sensenbrenner ( r-wisconsin ) said that the kyoto agreement has fatal defects and will definitely be vetoed by u.s. senate .
sensenbrenner said :
&quot; the agreement is currently put aside and it will be dead on arrival the senate . u.s. senate will never approve such an agreement .
the question is what can we do now ?
should we try to save it or should we announce the agreement has fatal defects and a new debate is necessary . &quot;
rep. james sensenbrenner said that the issue is not a fight between the two parties either in u.s. senate or in u.s. house of representatives . several famous democratic congress members also agreed .
democratic rep. ron klink ( r-pennsylvania ) said that he is against the accord because it will reduce job opportunities and cause a de-industrialization in u.s.
however , democratic rep. jim traficant ( r-ohio ) did not agree with sensenbrenner &apos;s view . he took the global warming phenomenon and compares it as war and peace in the world .
he said the same determination could ensure a victory for the kyoto accord .
traficant said :
&quot; i hope the process can continue and we cannot ignore the necessity to reach a global solution just because of a certain stubborn congress member . it should continue with or without the participation of u.s. congress &quot; .
in the main conference hall in buenos aires , delegates are discussing different types of questions . however , it is likely that many of these questions have to be left to wednesday &apos;s meeting and to be solved by the resources and environmental ministers of the 160 participating countries .
the u.s. delegates said that some issues of concern to u.s. congress might have to be delayed to next meeting for solutions . nevertheless , this meeting has achieved some progress .
six arabian countries in the gulf area together with syria and egypt urged iraq to comply with united nations weapon inspection resolution . they said this is necessary to avoid what they believe to be a confront that will only injure iraq civilians .
the white house welcomed the declaration and has taken it as another evidence that iraq &apos;s leader , saddam hussein , is facing isolation in the world . however , the majority of the people in iraq do not appear to care too much about another possible bombing by u.s.
&quot; tibet information network &quot; , a human right organization with its headquarter in london , disclosed that agya rinpoche , a respected religious leader in tibet , escaped to u.s. as a protest of china &apos;s tibet policy .
&quot; tibet information network &quot; said that agya rinpoche was apparently provoked by beijing &apos;s attempt to reform temples in areas of unrest ( in tibet ) and rejected dalai lama &apos;s choice of panchen lama reincarnation boy .
however , &quot; tibet information network &quot; said that it is not known at this moment whether agya rinpoche will apply for asylum in the states .
a u.s. arms-control delegation is in beijing and they want china to join the missile technology control regime as soon as possible . china may be exporting missile technology to other countries at this moment .
please listen to the following comprehensive report by voice of america reporter , fang yuan :
a group of u.s. officials , led by u.s. undersecretary of state , john holum , discussed with china foreign minister , tang jiaxuan , deputy chief of staff of chinese army , xiong guangkai and arms-control experts of the chinese army about the possibility of china joining the missile technology control regime . the meeting lasted for a day and half .
the focus of discussion is how to conclude the indication made by jiang zeming , president of the people &apos;s republic of china , this june when president clinton visited china .
at that time , jiang zeming indicated that china would consider joining the missile technology control regime . the indication has been taken as the principle result of the meeting between the two state heads .
a member of the u.s. delegation indicated to associated press that u.s. suspects china might still be exporting missile parts or missile technology . pakistan and iran are the two beneficiaries for china &apos;s missile technology export .
this official said that u.s. would continue to put the issue to china . nevertheless , he thought that china is also trying some measures to solve the problem .
china &apos;s export of missile technology causes frequent conflicts in sino-us relations .
since the two south asia sub-continent countries , india and pakistan , conducted nuclear tests one after the other in the first half of this year , u.s. sensed the importance to obtain an undertaking from china on the issue of transfer of missile technology . pakistan , one of the competing opponents in the south asia sub-continent , is a long time alliance of china .
as early as 1993 , u.s. imposed an economic sanction on china because china sold missile parts and technology to pakistan . the sanction was lifted in 1994 after china stopped the export of surface-to-surface missiles .
u.s. is worrying that missile trades between china and iran might affect u.s. allies in middle east and hence a major threat to u.s. interests .
however , the u.s. official disclosing the previously mentioned information did not wish to go into details as to when and as to what sort of missile technology that china had provided pakistan and iran .
he said that there is not enough evidence at this point to prove china have indeed exported missile technology to the two countries .
in the past , whenever u.s. had evidence to show that china exported missile technology to these two countries , china usually denied it completely or otherwise suggested the technologies have more than one use and china was exporting them for peace usage .
up till now , china has not made any open response to comments by officials of the u.s. delegation .
furthermore , according to associated press in beijing , washington already determined that north korea was helping pakistan in missile development and the launch of ghauri missile in april this year .
the above-mentioned is the comprehensive report by fang yuan , your reporter here in voice of america .
we already know the effect of climate changes . the consequences of el nino phenomenon last year included a huge continuous fire in indonesia ; flooding in barren desert area in peru ; and serious climate abnormity in extensive areas around the world .
for example , there were flooding in california and other southern u.s. states earlier this year and droughts occurred afterwards in many areas in the south .
according to experts , el nino is turning into a new phenomenon , which is called la nina .
it is likely that la nina will cause a new series of astonishing weather phenomenon next year that is comparable to el nino .
please listen to the report from li lan , voice of america chicago . qi zhifeng is making news at this hour .
chicago used to have freezing winters . however , last year was much warmer than the years before . snowfall was lower than before and next winter may also be something similar .
meanwhile , el nino was also raging in southeast asia . rainfall decreased and drought caused bush fires that were out of control for weeks .
el nino and la nina are the results of significant changes in sea surface temperature in east tropical pacific .
el nino refers to sea surface temperature that is much higher than normal . this affects the airflow and wind , which in turn causes changes in climates in different parts of the world .
la nina refers to the sea surface temperature that is lower than normal in tropical pacific . this will cause weather effects that are opposite to el nino in different parts of the world .
lafu , an expert of u.s. state climatology office , said that there may not be any out of control fire in indonesia next year because rainfall in that area from december this year to march next year is forecasted to be more than last year .
at the same time , the average temperature in western africa and southeast africa is a bit lower than normal while the northern part of south america may have more than average rains .
the southern part of u.s. will be drier . this may mean continuous drought in texas and new mexico while the chance of a forest fire in florida is higher than normal .
el nino has also caused torrential rains in california and in the southern part of the states this year .
lafu said that el nino does not produce torrential rains itself but it creates conditions that facilitate the formation of serious rainstorm .
this year , u.s. has the hottest summer ever known in history .
many people have linked el nino phenomenon to global warming .
lafu thought that such association is possible but there is no way to prove it at this moment .
no matter what the reason may be , it probably means the coming winters in north and central western areas of u.s. will be one colder than the other . it is also sure that we will have more snow in winters .
meanwhile , chinese and local indonesians are guarding their homes together in chinatown area in jakarta , indonesia .
since the serious riots in may , the chinatown is facing the impact of yet another violence .
please listen to another report from voice of america &apos;s correspondent in jakarta .
as the curtain of darkness arrived , troops tried to disperse those young men throwing stones at soldiers in the chinatown areas by firing their guns as warning .
a few hours ago , several thousands of people gathered before a bank , which is not more than one kilometer from the president &apos;s palace . the mob set fire on the bank , which soon spread to nearby shops .
a group of young men forced open the shop gate with the pole of the street lamp .
on saturday , attacks were targeted at the chinese . a crown dragged a chinese to the street , beat him up and threw him into a water channel .
troops arrived in an armed troop carrier and saved the seriously wounded man .
tanks were patrolling streets that were full of stones and broken glasses . thousands of soldiers carrying rifles and tear gas were guarding local commercial areas and kept the mobs away .
merchants selling electrical goods there had relocated their shops after the riot in may .
the reporter came across a young man ( 29 years old ) with the family name min . he was wearing only shorts and a belt while guarding behind a roadblock made of wire meshes
this young man , working for a computer company , together with his muslim neighbor were protecting the area throughout the night in order to keep the mobs away from their homes .
mr. min said that his neighbor made the wire mesh barrier after the riot in may . they never thought it could be of use this soon .
many roadblocks have been set up in different areas and residents are carrying big wooden rods to drive away strangers .
i came across another resident wearing a muslim head and a muslim sarong .
the man told this reporter that most of the young robbers rushed here from areas outside the chinatown after they heard a riot had broken out here .
the mob robbed and destroyed a subway station near the highway . when troops chased them , they threw away shoes , calculators and coat hangers etc . , which scattered all over the road .
the international court of justice at hague found the three defendants guilty of war crimes against the bosnia serbs . nevertheless , their senior commanding officer was found not guilty .

the other three defendants were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonments because of their role in what was described by prisoners as reign of terror .
dear audience , let &apos;s look at some situations in china .
the chinese government arrested several dissidents a few days ago in an attempt to stop a get together of the members of china democracy party in zhejiang and shanghai .
please listen to the report from the chinese division of voice of america . qing yue is making news at this hour .
according to information from the hong kong based china information center for human rights &amp; democracy , hang zhou public security officers took two members of china democracy party , namely zhu zhengming and mao qingxiang , away from their homes on friday afternoon .

the china information center for human rights &amp; democracy said that approximately twenty members of the zhejiang and shanghai branch of china democracy party planned to have their first meeting in a hotel in hangzhou shi on friday afternoon .
in light of the forthcoming meeting , the policy made the arrests .
furthermore , public security officers in different cities of zhejiang warned some democratic movement activists not to leave their home or otherwise will be arrested .
the chinese government regards opposition political parties , like china democracy party , as illegal organizations . the government did arrest and interrogated a few dozen supporters and activists of this organization .
however , most of them were released after a short while .
associated press , reuters and agence france-presse had separately reported the latest situations in china released by china information center for human rights &amp; democracy .

first , let &apos;s look at canada in below .
sergio marchi , minister of international trade of canada indicated that canada should export its own concept of values in tandem with the export of trades and products . this can help improve human right in china as well as other asian countries .
marchi made the point in response to the standing senate committee on foreign affairs &apos; suggestion that trades should be tied with human rights
please listen to yan ming &apos;s report , voice of america toronto .
canada minister of international trade , marchi , made a very positive response to the suggestion detailed in a report by the standing senate committee on foreign affairs , which says trades should be tied with human rights .
marchi said that canada should incorporate a new factor , that is human rights , into canada &apos;s foreign trade policy .
according to the newspaper , ottawa citizen , minister of international trade marchi said the above words during a meeting on foreign affairs and international trades in ottawa on thursday .
marchi also indicated that from what he saw whilst attending the apec summit meeting in malaysia and then the arrest of dissidents by chinese authorities in recent days , he firmly believes canada should export its own values in tandem with export of its products . it does not matter whether the export is a provision of economic aid or the export is an international trade .
according to marchi , human rights and social justice should be made important contents in canada &apos;s foreign trade policy .
the canadian press said that the report from the standing senate committee on foreign affairs suggested the canadian government to re-examine different types of foreign aids such as to ensure local human right status can be improved simultaneously with any economic development in the receiving country .
according to the globe and mail , all sorts of signs indicated that the canadian government is attempting to adjust its foreign policy , including policy towards china and other asian countries . the standing senate committee report is only one of the many signals .
on thursday , canada &apos;s minister of foreign affairs , lloyd axworthy , expressed high concern to china &apos;s arrest of dissidents .
&quot; we must make a response to this matter &quot; , he said .
&quot; we have already pointed out to the chinese government - arrest of people with different political views violates the united nations covenant on civil and political rights .
according to canadian press , canada has not made any open criticism against china for more than two years . however , canada prime minister jean chretien completely abandoned the practice and criticized china &apos;s human rights records several times in open occasions during his visit to china last month .
the canadian prime minister &apos;s unusual course of action actually illustrated that canada is making changes to its foreign policy .
according to a report in the globe and mail , canadian commercial sectors have different opinions towards marchi &apos;s position of supporting a tie between trades and human rights .
many are worrying privately that such a tie may affect the business of large canadian enterprises .
nevertheless , zhu yuchao , ph. d. , of okanagan university college , british columbia , has a different view :
&quot; as far as north america capitalists are concerned , investors may go and invest in southeast asia . they can build factory there and they can do trading there . the most important reason is to make money . true , they need to make a profit .
however , when they enter these southeast countries , they can bring some standards to these countries with them . for example , in the area of labor protection , they can introduce labor protection concepts and standards of fringe benefits etc. to these countries . in addition , they can bring environmental requirements as well . all these will benefit both sides to the deal .
furthermore , the person introducing these concepts plays a demonstration role . he can help improve the human rights in that country . labor rights are concepts that are easy to understand and yet such concepts can have a very direct impact to human rights .
the above is the report from yan ming , voice of america toronto .
u.s. and north korea continued talks on friday about the inspection of a suspected underground nuclear facility near pyongyang .
the delegates from both sides held talks for two days in new york . they then moved to washington and are continuing further discussions there .
last month , both sides held similar talks in pyongyang .
at that time , discussions broke down because north korea made a certain demand .
north korea requested u.s. to provide them with us $ 300 million in exchange for north korea &apos;s undertaking to let inspection personnel to enter and perform inspections at all relevant locations .
before this new series of meeting , north korea launched a series of publicity attack on u.s.
cheng huaren , person in charge at state economic and trade commission indicated that the chinese army and other government departments have to break off their control over subordinate enterprises in the near future .
notwithstanding that the chinese government has issued several similar orders before , it appears the determination this time is much stronger .
please listen to the report prepared by voice of america correspondent ning xin .
according to cheng huaren , person in charge at state economic and trade commission , the chinese army has to break off all relations with subordinate companies and enterprises before december 20 .
all other party , government and judicial departments must start similar actions at the beginning of next year .
jiang zeming , president of china , ordered the army and the police to stop operating enterprises , hotels and other commercial facilities in july this year in order to control corruptions and smugglings that are getting worst everyday inside the army .
according to cheng huaren , some enterprises under the control of the army in shanghai and tianjin have already been transferred to local governments . however , he did not say whether the army received any compensation or not .
the army is not alone in this . other party , government and judicial departments must rescind all control and management of subordinate state enterprises .
china &apos;s state enterprises have more than 100 million employees . many of these state enterprises are actually on the verge of bankruptcy because of serious bad debts , &quot; dead debts &quot; , and weakness in export markets due to global economic crisis .
according to cheng huaren , many state enterprises are currently employing ten times the number of employees that they actually needed . this has intensified the loss situation in many state enterprises in the past one-year .
the fact indicates it is an urgent task to improve the competitive position of state enterprises in the market .
in addition , analysts thought that corruptions and poor management are common in government departments and judicial departments that are currently in charge of these state enterprises .
the most common situation is that many government officials are in charge of a certain industry but at the same time they are also in charge of the operations of enterprises in the same industry .
these officials can then use authority of their offices and supply contracts , loans and preferential tax treatments to enterprises connected to them .
this phenomenon destroyed fair competition in the market and obstructed china &apos;s migration from a planned economy to a market economy .
it is understood that the largest state enterprises , actually over 500 of them , formerly under control of party , government or judicial departments are to be supervised by a newly formed committee in the state council . the employees in these state enterprises will be looked after by the state personnel department .
local governments will manage smaller state enterprises .
the ministry of finance will centralize the supervision and control of financial and investment companies .
it is not clear at this point in time whether these changes will mean a reduction in loans from the state and hence , for these large state enterprises , a gradual moves towards bankruptcy .
according to some analysts , china may resort to merger rather than bankruptcy to solve the problem of serious losses in state enterprises . there are concerns that high unemployment may impact the stability of the society .
the above is the comprehensive report by ning xin , voice of america .

preliminary observation by united nations economic commission suggests that latin america and caribbean region may have an economic growth of 2.3 % this year , which is a sharp drop from the 5.2 % growth last year .

however , bad impacts are gradually surfacing and may continue into next year .

indonesian police summoned a reporter over a story on the rape of chinese women in may riot
( agence france-presse , jakarta ) an international press-freedom organization , &quot; committee to protect journalists &quot; , expressed alarm at the indonesian police summons against a reporter over a story on the rape of chinese women in may riot .
reporter goenawan of &quot; jakarta-jakarta &quot; magazine has been told to appear at the police headquarters for questions , the new york based committee to protect journalists said .
according to the committee , goenawan published a story in july quoting the words of a chinese woman who was raped .
the &quot; new york times &quot; also published a story on june 10 quoting the words of the same victim .
in a letter to indonesian president habibie , the committee said that by issuing a summons , &quot; the police have taken the first step towards prosecution &quot; .
the committee was &quot; concerned that the use of such laws can have a negative impact on freedom of expression &quot; .
the committee was referring to pressure by a group of indonesian muslim organizations to the government . these organizations demanded that goenawan be arrested under article 156 of the criminal code .
the code prohibits people from defaming a religious group .
the international alliance of independent journalists also protested against the police summons to goenawan .
this could set &quot; a precedent that could set back the increased freedom enjoyed by the press since the fall of former president suharto &quot; , the alliance said .
the committee to protect journalists urged habibie to &quot; stop disturbing goenawan &quot; and should ask all parities to settle their disputes in a civil court .

portugal to discuss excessive indonesian troops in east timor with united nations official
( agence france-presse , lisbon ) according to reliable information , portugal foreign minister gama is going to meet an official of united nations in vienna tomorrow to discuss the report of excessive indonesian troops in east timor .
the spokesman for gama said that the subject of the related report is inconsistent with the guarantee made by indonesia foreign minister alatas to united nations secretary general annan in august .
the spokesman said that alatas did guarantee a gradual reduction of indonesian troops in east timor .
information sources revealed that gama is going to discuss the relevant development with a special envoy of annan .
according to some documents , which appear to be classified documents of the indonesian army , now circulating among foreign correspondents , the number of indonesian troops stationed in east timor was 17,834 men as at end of july this year .
according to a western embassy , this number is quite close to their estimate .
however , the commander-in-chief of indonesian armed force , general wiranto , said that the number of seventeen thousand is a &quot; lie &quot; .
however , he did not disclose the actual number . according to a military official , there were about fifteen thousand soldiers stationed in east timor in mid-august .
indonesia dispatched troops to east timor in 1975 and annexed it in the following year .

u.s. federal reserve may cut interest rate again
( reuters , washington ) u.s. federal reserve board vice chairman rivlin warned on monday that the global financial crisis might cause a significant slowdown in u.s. economy . she hinted that u.s. might need more interest cuts in order to avoid an economic recession .
she did not think the u.s. economy is going to collapse , rivlin said during an interview . however , she warned that export volume may drop and poor job opportunities may mean a significant slowdown in the economy .
the federal reserve board cut interest rate twice in the past 6 weeks in an attempt to minimize the impacts to u.s. economy because of the most serious financial crisis in the past 50 years .
federal reserve &apos;s next meeting is on november 17 and will discuss whether it is appropriate to cut interest rate again .
most people guess the board will favor another cut to stabilize the economy .
u.s. third quarter growth is 3.3 % , which is lower than the 5.5 % recorded in first quarter .
most forecasts anticipate a further slow down in the economy in the next few months .
this is because u.s. is likely to export less to asia and hence causes an impact to investment and production volume in the manufacturing sector .
rivlin pointed out that the massive pressure on u.s. financial markets had slightly reduced in the past several weeks .
however , she warned that there still appears to be a credit squeeze .
according to rivlin , the world economy has not shrugged off the crisis completely .
the recovery in asia is still in the preliminary stage .
the economy in japan , the world &apos;s second largest economy , has not fully recovered while the economic situation in russia is &quot; still bad &quot; .

( kuala lumpur ) lien hoe berhad expects to be able to redeem the remaining 65 % ( malaysian ringgit 53.81 million ) of the bond before the end of the year through loans to be obtained from banks .
the total issued amount of lien hoe berhad 6 % redeemable guaranteed bond was rm 85.74 million and the maturity date was august 17 , 1998 .

last month , the securities trading commission approved the maturity date extension of lien hoe berhad &apos;s bond to august 17 , 2000 . this is the first time in malaysia that a group of companies has successfully obtained a maturity date extension for its bonds .
given that interest rate is heading down in the markets , lien hoe berhad plans to use bank loans to redeem the remaining bond and avoids paying a high interest rate of 15 % to bond holders .
according to the managing director of lien hoe berhad , the company expects to reverse its inferior position recorded in first half of this year . he cited the current trend of a lower interest rate and the new fiscal budget appears to benefit real estate development as reasons . he expects the company to achieve a satisfactory result in the second half of this year .
in portugal , a member of parliament requested the extradition of suharto

nuno correia da silva , a member of parliament , said in a letter that suharto should be extradited for his violations of human rights in east timor .
indonesia invaded the portuguese colony in 1975 and annexed east timor after several weeks .
&quot; we are studying whether it is possible to do so in portuguese law &quot; , said sara pina , a spokeswoman for the attorney general &apos;s office .
human rights groups have accused indonesian troops of numerous violations of human rights in east timor .
correia da silva said that the recent attempt to extradite former chilean dictator pinochet to spain for charges including genocide has strengthened his determination to extradite suharto .
pinochet is currently in london awaiting a house of lords decision on his extradition .
the british supreme court rescinded the original arrest warrant against pinochet on the grounds that pinochet entitles to immunity from prosecution as a former chief of state .
correia da silva is a member of portugal &apos;s right wing popular party .
united nations still regards portugal as the legitimate administrative power in east timor and this should help the request to extradite suharto , he said .

the discovery is important to the research and classification of dinosaurs in xixia regions . it is helpful to the exploration of ecological habits and breeding behavior of dinosaurs . the ability to reproduce the ecosystem prevailing in the dinosaur era has very important meaning -- it can reveal changes occurred in earth crust and related evolution pattern in our environment .
the discovery also provides an important clue to the geographic location pattern and can aid future dinosaur discovery works .

settlement deal on boston abusive priest scrapped
( afp report from boston ) boston &apos;s archdiocese reached a multimillion-dollar settlement agreement to appease the victims who were sexually abused by roman catholic priest geoghan . however , the archdiocese suddenly backed out of the deal , claiming that scores of the plaintiffs alleged to have been sexually advanced by geoghan were weighing legal options .
in an unexpected move , the archdiocese pulled out of the 20-to-30-million-dollar agreement reached in march with 86 alleged child victims , citing extreme financial hardship after its financial advisers reviewed the agreement .
the archdiocesan finance committee said in a statement : &quot; the proposed settlement would consume much of the resources the archdiocese can reasonably attain and , therefore , it would leave the archdiocese unable to provide a just and proportional response to other victims . &quot;
under the annulled deal , independent mediators would assess every individual case , paying victims some one million dollars to those who suffered the most and 25,000 dollars to the less victimized .
the archdiocesan finance committee held that the deal would bankrupt the archdiocesan since there was an increasing number of allegations of sexual abuse emerging and &quot; dramatic changes had taken place after the agreement was put forward &quot; .
sixty-six-year-old geoghan was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for having sexually abused a 10-year-old boy in 1991 .
he has been removed from his post and faces some other criminal trials and scores of civil lawsuits .

( afp report from washington , d.c. ) the us bush administration has shown its indifference to cuban president castro &apos;s goodwill towards former us president carter , who is paying a landmark visit to the communist island .
castro said he would allow carter to meet with dissidents and visit any place at his will , including laboratories that washington claims are producing biological weapons .

ministers of the oecd in paris looking into world economic prospect
( afp report from paris ) senior ministers of the world &apos;s major industrialized countries kicked off a two-day meeting in paris on may 15th , looking into a hopeful economic prospect , only to be overshadowed by a rift caused by the trade disputes between the united states and the europe .
representatives from 30 member countries of the organization of economic cooperation and development would also focus on the disputes brought about in the process of narrowing the gap between the developed and the developing countries .
however , discussions on the macro economy were likely to be sidelined by the intensified trade disputes between the united states and the european union .
european leaders expressed their indignation over a bill signed by president bush on may 13th , which would allow the government to increase the subsidies by 70 % for us farmers in the coming 10 years .
eu officials said that the bill had pushed the united states to back out of its promise of putting an end to agricultural subsidies made at the ministerial meeting of the world trade organization in the qatari capital of doha last november .
speaking at a forum before the ministerial meeting , belgian prime minister verhofstadt said : &quot; the empty talk of the free market and short of implementation is a hypocritical act . &quot;
mid-term election likely to slow us pace in pushing free trade
( afp report from washington ) economists and analysts said that the many more trade barriers set up to woo voters in the mid-term election were likely to slow the pace of global free trade that the untied states had long been pushing .
economist choate with washington think-tank international economy research institution said : &quot; us president bush has decided to put political goals over the one that can help build up a healthy us economy . &quot;
he said that bowing to the pressure from the steel industry and the steel unions bush imposed a tax of up to 30 % on some steel products from several major suppliers , including the european union , russia , japan and brazil .
then bush imposed a 27 % anti-dumping import tax on some canadian wood used as construction materials , saying that the act of dumping existed since the canadian government gave subsidies to export the wood .
choate said that to make things worse , the federal government &apos;s recent &quot; agriculture law &quot; added subsidies to some agricultural products by nearly 80 % , which run counter to the promise that the united states made in the trade negotiations in the qatari capital of doha last november .
at the doha meeting , the united states stuck to an agricultural free trade to help poor countries &apos; agricultural products enter rich countries &apos; markets more easily .
at the same time , in free trade , it is also easier for developed countries to offer their products and services to poor countries .
choate said that the us agriculture law would do more harm to the free trade than measures to impose a steel import tax could do .

in the early trading , british airways &apos; stocks rose up 2.6 % at 241.75p.
it was down 8 % compared with that shortly before the 9.11 attacks , but slumped nearly 70 % with the highest 760p in may 1997 .
