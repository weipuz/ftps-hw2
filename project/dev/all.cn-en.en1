chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan also indicated at the press conference that it is really of great significance that he was able to meet with president clinton .
his excellency the president met with me , and i think our meeting has been very fruitful .
at present , president clinton is in a time of troubles . many people both inside and outside the united states have expressed their strong dissatisfaction and criticism toward president clinton because of his sex scandal .

at the conference , a reporter questioned tang jiaxuan whether president clinton &apos;s sex scandal will affect the sino-u.s. relations .
tang jiaxuan replied as follows :
i think this issue of whether it will affect the relations is entirely an internal affair of the united states .
i have never thought that this would affect the development of the sino-u.s. relations .
president clinton himself has made important and valuable contributions to the development of the sino-u.s. relations , and we will never forget the contributions he has made .
i , personally and representing china , sincerely hope that the sino-u.s. relations will continue to move forward substantially and steadily on the basis of the three communiques by the two nations and this joint statement by the leaders of both nations .

these three bodies were transported by air to mashhad , an iranian city where six bodies of iranians killed in mazar-i-sharif were shipped last month .

the delegates to the un global climate conference held in buenos aires , capital city of argentina , go on with their work .
meanwhile , the u.s. congress is debating over whether it should approve the agreement reached at kyoto conference last year .
according to another report from buenos aires by voa correspondent fulaikusi , a few u.s. congressmen have brought this debate to the conference hall in buenos aires on tuesday .
please listen to the following details , ma kaiyue reporting .
the democratic senators of the u.s. congress , lieberman and kerry , made a statement tuesday in buenos aires , urging the clinton administration to sign and approve this week the agreement reached at kyoto conference .
the two senators have both indicated that this will increase the persuasive power of the u.s. delegates and the likelihood that the developing countries will make commitments to reducing the green-house effect and volume of exhaust gas emission .
as a matter of fact , this is the prerequisite the senate proposed in the several previous bills .
however , some members of the u.s. house of representatives in buenos aires said that they are opposed to the clinton administration &apos;s making any of such action .
sensenbrenner jr . , a republican member of the house of representatives from wisconsin and chairman of its science subcommittee , said that kyoto agreement contains fatal flaws and will certainly be vetoed by the u.s. senate .
he said :
m.h.r. sensenbrenner said , just as the agreement is now pigeonholed , the agreement simply died on its way to the senate . the u.s. senate is not going to approve this agreement .
the question is what we can do at present .
shall we attempt to salvage the agreement , or shall we announce that the agreement has fatal flaws and should be discussed anew .
m.h.r. sensenbrenner said , this is not considered as a bipartisan contention either in the house of representatives or the senate . some well-known democratic representatives also expressed their agreement on this .
klink , a democratic representative from pennsylvania , said that he is opposed to this agreement because it will reduce the employment opportunities and also will reduce the degree of america &apos;s industrialization as he mentioned before .
however , kucinich , a democratic representative from ohio , did not agree with sensenbrenner &apos;s point of view . he likened the combat against the global warming to the endeavor for world peace .
he said that the same determination will make kyoto agreement a winner .
he said :
m.h.r. kucinichi said , i hope this process will continue . at the same time , we should not overlook the necessity of reaching a global solution simply because of some congressman &apos;s momentary stubbornness , no matter whether there is u.s. congress &apos; participation .
in the main conference hall in buenos aires , delegates are discussing various kinds of issues , some of which will surely be left for the ministers of energy and environment from the 160 participating nations to solve at the meeting on wednesday .
the u.s. delegates said , although some of the issues that the u.s. congress is more concerned about may have to wait for their solution till the conference next year , this conference still has made some progress .
the six arab countries in the gulf region , along with syria and egypt , called for iraq to abide by the un arms resolution on arms inspection so as to avoid the conflicts that , they say , would only hurt the iraqi civilians .
the white house expressed its welcome to this announcement and regarded it as another proof that saddam hussein is facing isolation in the world . however , most iraqis do not seem to care much about the possible bombings led by the united states .
&quot; tibet information network &quot; , a london-based human rights organization , indicated that ugyen trinley dorje , one of the most respected religious leaders in tibet , has escaped to the united states in protest against china &apos;s tibetan policy .
&quot; tibet information network &quot; said , ugyen trinley dorje seems to be angry with beijing &apos;s attempt to reform the temples in the disturbed tibetan area and its refusal to accept the chosen child appointed by dalai lama as the reincarnation of panchen lama .
however , &quot; tibet information network &quot; said that so far it is not yet clear whether ugyen trinley dorje will seek asylum in the united states .
a u.s. arms control delegation on its way to beijing to discuss china &apos;s earliest possible entry into the missile technology control regime thinks that china may still be exporting its missile technology to other countries .
now , please listen to voa correspondent fang yuan &apos;s comprehensive coverage .
a group of u.s. officials led by holum , the acting under secretary of the u.s. state department , had a meeting in beijing with tang jiaxuan , the chinese foreign minister , xiong guangkai , the deputy chief of the general staff of the chinese military and other chinese arms control experts . the meeting lasted a day and half and covered the issue of china &apos;s entry into the missile technology control regime .
the meeting mainly focused on how to materialize what jiang zemin , chairman of the people &apos;s republic of china , indicated during president clinton &apos;s visit in china in june this year .
at the time , jiang zemin indicated that china would consider its entry into the missile technology control regime , which was already considered as one of the major achievements from the summit meeting between the united states and china .
one member of the u.s. delegation indicated to the associated press that the american side has some concerns about whether china is still exporting missile parts or missile technology while pakistan and iran have benefited from the missile technology exported by china .
this official said that the united states will continue to ask china this question and that he believes china is also taking measures to solve these problems .
china &apos;s export of missile technology has been an issue that often causes frictions in the sino-u.s. relations .
since india and pakistan , the two long-time foes in south asia subcontinent , successively conducted nuclear tests in the first half of this year , the united states has felt a stronger need that china should make commitments to controlling the transfer of missile technology , because pakistan , one of the adversaries in the nuclear arms race in south asia subcontinent , is a long-time ally of china .
the united states imposed economic sanctions against china as early as in 1993 when china sold missile parts and technology to pakistan . only when china promised to stop exporting the surface-to-surface missiles did the united states call off the sanctions against china in 1994 .
the united states is also concerned that the missile transactions between china and iran will pose serious threats to the u.s. allies in the middle east and to the u.s. interests .
however , the u.s. official who disclosed the above information declined elaborating on what kind of missile technology china has supplied to pakistan and iran and when these technologies are provided .
he said , so far there hasn &apos;t been sufficient evidence to prove that china has indeed exported the missile technology to these two countries .
as ever before , whenever the united states obtained the evidence that china exported the missile technology to these two countries , china would either deny it or claim that these technologies are the so-called dual-purpose technologies and that the technologies it exported were used for peaceful purposes .
as of now , the chinese side has not made any public response to the remark made by the official from the u.s. delegation .
in addition , according to a report from the associated press in beijing , washington has already confirmed that the country that helped pakistan in the research and development of a ghauri missile that was launched in april of this year is not china but north korea .
the above is a comprehensive coverage by voa correspondent fang yuan .
from meteorological perspective , we know that el nino last year caused serious consequences , including the incessant conflagrations in indonesia , the floods in the desert areas in peru , and serious abnormality in regional climates throughout the world .
in the united states , flood hit california and all the southern states at the beginning of the year . after that , drought occurred in many parts of the south .
according to the experts , el nino is now transforming into a new phenomenon called la nina .
and la nina is going to create a sensation next year no less than that by el nino .
now please listen to a report from chicago by voa correspondent li lan . your announcer is qi zhifeng .
in chicago , where it used to be very cold in winter , it was much warmer last year with a much smaller snowfall . it is probably not going to be very different next winter .
meanwhile , el nino played havoc in southeast asia with drastic decrease in precipitation and drought-induced wild fire that burned out of control for weeks .
both el nino and la nina resulted from a substantial change in surface water temperature in the tropical eastern pacific ocean .
el nino refers to a surface water temperature much higher than normal that affects the movement of air currents and consequently changes the regional climates in various parts of the world .
la nina refers to a surface water temperature much lower than normal that affects many regional climates in exactly the opposite way as el nino does .
lafu , a meteorologist from the u.s. national weather service , said that next year &apos;s conflagrations in indonesia may not burn out of control as the rainfall in the region from december of this year to next march is estimated to be larger than usual .
at the same time , west africa and southeast africa will have a lower than usual temperature , while there will be more rainfall in the northern part of south america .
the southern half of the united states will be drier than usual . this means that there may be prolonged drought in texas and new mexico , while forest fires in florida are more likely than usual .
the torrential rain that fell in california and the south this year was all attributed to el nino .
el nino , lafu said , will not cause rainstorms but will provide conditions for the forming of serious rainstorms .
this summer is one of the hottest in the history of the united states .
some people link the global warming with el nino .
lafu thinks there is a possibility for this association but so far it is not yet confirmed .
yet , no matter what other reasons there may be , to people in the united states , it means the coming winter in the north and the midwest will be much colder and with more snowfall than last year .
meanwhile , in chinatown area of jakarta , capital city of indonesia , the chinese and local indians stand side by side to protect their houses .

mr. min said , after the riot in may , he and his neighbors made this barbed-wire barricade but they never expected that they would have to make use of it so soon .
in places where there are barricades , residents carrying big batons are driving away hordes of strangers .
a resident named daxiyate wears a turban and muslim robe .
he told the reporter that most of these young looters must have heard about the riot here and have rushed over from places outside chinatown .
the rioters looted and destroyed a subway station a kilometer away from here . when the soldiers chased them , the shoes , computers and clothes hangers that they abandoned in their flight were strewn everywhere along the road .
the international criminal tribunal in the hague found three defendants guilty of war crimes against bosnian serbs yet declared their superior commander innocent .

the other three defendants are sentenced to set term of imprisonment due to their roles in the so-called reign of terror in the prisoner-of-war camp .

now , let &apos;s first take a look at canada .
marchi , minister of international trade of canada , indicated that while canada exports merchandise , it should also export its values in an effort to improve human rights conditions in china and other asian countries .
marchi made this remark as a response to the proposal of linking foreign trade with human rights by the diplomatic committee of the canadian parliament .
now , please listen to a report from voa correspondent yan ming in toronto .
marchi , minister of international trade of canada , made a very positive response to the proposal of linking foreign trade with human rights put forward in a report by the diplomatic committee of the canadian senate .
marchi indicated that canada should add human rights as a new factor to its foreign trade policy .
ottawa citizen reported that marchi , minister of international trade of canada , made this remark while attending a conference on diplomacy and international trade on thursday in ottawa .
marchi indicated , what he saw in malaysia not long ago while attending the summit meeting of asian pacific economic cooperation organizations there and the recent news about china &apos;s arrest of dissidents and so forth have convinced him that canada should export its values while exporting its merchandise no matter whether it is providing economic aid or is engaged in international trade .
human rights and social justice should become an important part of the canadian foreign trade policy .
according to a report from the canadian press , the report from diplomatic committee of the canadian senate proposes that the canadian government should review all the foreign aid projects , making sure that while they help the recipient countries in their economic development , they should also help improve human rights conditions there .
national post reports that various signs indicate that the canadian government is trying to adjust its policy toward asian countries , including china ; and the report from diplomatic committee of the canadian senate is only one of the various signals .
on thursday , canadian foreign minister axworthy indicated that canada is greatly concerned over china &apos;s arrest of dissidents .
he said , we must respond to this incident .
we have already pointed out to the chinese government that the arrest of dissidents violates the un covenant on civil and political rights that china signed .
the canadian press reports that as a matter of fact , during his visit in china last month , canadian prime minister chretrien changed his practice of making no public censure on china over the last two years and criticized china for its human rights record on several public occasions .
this unusual practice from the canadian prime minister has in fact already indicated that canada has made some changes in its foreign policy .
national post reports that people in canada &apos;s business circle have mixed responses to international trade minister marchi &apos;s support of linking trade with human rights .
in private , some people are worried , fearing it might affect the businesses in canada .
however , dr. zhu yuchao of okanagan university of british columbia , canada , holds a very different opinion .
to the capitalists in north america , it does , because they relocate to east asia to invest , build plants , do trade with making profits as one of their important reasons . of course , there should be profits .
however , while they go to these countries in east asia , they can also bring some standards such as labor protection , labor welfare and requirements for environmental protection to these countries . this is bilateral .
and the person who brings these there also serves as a model . this is going to exert a very direct influence on the improvement of the local human rights conditions and more directly on labor rights . it is a very direct influence .
the above is a report from voa special correspondent yan ming in toronto .
the united states and north korea plan to continue the talk on friday about inspecting a place near pyongyang suspected of being an underground nuclear facility .
delegates from both sides will hold a two-day talk in new york and then continue the talk in washington .
last month , both sides held a similar talk in pyongyang .
at the time , the talk broke down because of a demand brought forward by north korea .
north korea demanded that the united states provide 300 million us dollars in exchange for north korea &apos;s guarantee for inspectors to enter all the locations concerned to conduct inspection .
prior to the new talk , north korea made a series of attacks on the united states .
sheng huaren , a chief officer from national economics and trade committee of china , indicated that the chinese military and other government agencies will entirely give up the control of their subordinate enterprises within a short period of time .
although china issued similar directives several times in the past , its determination to take the action this time seems to be greater than before .
now , please listen to a report written by voa correspondent ning xin .
sheng huaren , a chief officer from the national economics and trade committee of china , indicated that the chinese military will separate themselves completely from their subordinate enterprises by dec . 20 .
other party and government agencies and judicial departments must also take similar actions early next year .
in july this year , jiang zemin , chairman of the people &apos;s republic of china , ordered the military and people &apos;s armed police to stop operating enterprises , hotels and other commercial facilities in order to control the ever-spreading corruption and smuggling within the armed forces .
sheng huaren indicated that as of now , some enterprises subordinate to the military in shanghai and tianjin have already shifted their control to the local governments , but he did not clarify whether the military will be compensated .
in addition to the military that must hand over the control of its subordinate enterprises , the party , government agencies and judicial departments shall also stop operating the state-owned enterprises subordinate to them .
there are over 100 million of employees in the state-owned enterprises . due to serious problems of bad debts , dead accounts and the slowdown in the export market resulting from the global economic crisis , many state-owned enterprises are actually on the brink of bankruptcy .
sheng huaren said , at present , in many state-owned enterprises , the number of people employed is over ten times more than the actual number needed . as a result , these businesses suffered even greater losses last year .
this demonstrates that increasing the market competitiveness of the state-owned enterprises has become a top priority at the moment .
in addition , analysts claim that there are widespread corruption and mismanagement in the government agencies and judicial departments that supervise the state-owned enterprise .
the most common scenario is that many government officials in charge of one industry are at the same time in charge of the operation of enterprises in the same industry .
therefore , they can take advantage of the power associated with their positions to provide these enterprises with preferential treatment in respect of contracts , loans and taxes .
this phenomenon harms the fair competition in the marketplace and consequently hinders china &apos;s transition from the planned economy to the free market economy .
it is learned that the 500-plus largest state-owned enterprises originally subordinate to the party and government agencies and judicial departments would be placed under the supervision of a newly established committee under the state council . the employees of these enterprises will be managed by the personnel department .
smaller enterprises will be managed by the local government .
in addition , financial and investment companies will also be placed under the uniform management of the ministry of finance .
at present , it is not clear whether these changes mean the government will reduce the loans to the state-owned enterprises so as to let some large enterprises go bankrupt step by step .
some analysts think that china , for fear that high unemployment rate might give rise to social disturbances , may solve the problem of losses in the state-owned enterprises mainly through mergers rather than bankruptcy .
the above is a comprehensive report by voa correspondent ning xin .

according to the preliminary observation by the un economic commission , the economic growth rate in latin america and the caribbean will be 2.3 % this year , a sharp drop from 5.2 % of last year .
this year &apos;s figure could have been even lower , if it hadn &apos;t been for the strong economic performance in the first half of the year .
the commission said , despite the external shocks , the economic performance in the region is relatively fine .
however , the worst impact has evidenced itself now and will last till next year .
the un economic commission said , the economic hardship in brazil is reflected in some countries in the southern cone region .
most of these countries are affected by the low price for primary exports .
the commission said , most countries chose to raise interest rate so as to protect their own currencies .
this measure put restraints on economic growth and pushed up the unemployment rate .
the report said if these countries try to maintain a stronger competitiveness in the global market by means of currency depreciation , they will run the risk of worsening inflation , actually ...

reporting on the rape of a chinese woman during the may riot , journalist subpoenaed by indonesian police for interrogation
( jakarta , afp wire ) the international organization &quot; committee to protect journalists &quot; that defends the freedom of the press expressed its shock at the indonesian police &apos;s subpoena of a journalist for interrogation because he reported on the rape of a chinese woman during the may riot .

the committee is &quot; very concerned that such application of the law would bring negative impact on the freedom of speech . &quot;
the committee is referring here to the fact that the indonesian muslim organizations have put pressure on the government and demanded that the government arrest gunawan under article 156 of the criminal code .
the article forbids people from libeling religious groups .
international alliance of independent journalists also protested against the police for subpoenaing gunawan .
it said , this will &quot; set a precedent and weaken the greater freedom of the press that the media has enjoyed since the ex-president suharto stepped down . &quot;

foreign minister of portugal to talk with un officials on excessive indonesian troops in east timor
( lisbon , afp wire ) as disclosed by reliable sources , gama , foreign minister of portugal , will meet with a un official in vienna to discuss the report that there is excessive indonesian military presence in east timor .
cesar , spokesman for gama , said that this report contradicts the guarantee that alatas , foreign minister of indonesia , made to gama and un secretary-general annan in august .
cesar said , alatas once promised to gradually reduce indonesia &apos;s military presence in east timor .
the sources disclosed that gama will discuss the related development with annan &apos;s special representative mark .
according to an apparently confidential document of the indonesian military circulating among the foreign journalists , there are 17,834 indonesian soldiers stationed in east timor as of the end of july this year .
the western embassies said this figure is very close to what they have estimated .
however , general wiranto , commander-in-chief of the indonesian armed forces , said that the figure 17,000 is a &quot; lie &quot; .
he did not reveal the real figure , but the military officials once indicated that about 11,500 soldiers were stationed in east timor in mid august .
indonesia sent troops to east timor as early as in 1975 , and annexed east timor the next year .
however , the united nations still considers lisbon as the official administrator of east timor .
the un secretary-generals have been sponsoring peace talks between portugal and indonesia since 1983 .
the leaders of east timor , including nobel prize winner belo and gusmao , leader of the guerrilla forces of independence movement of east timor held in jail , all made statements supporting this report and refuting jakarta &apos;s claim that the troops in east timor have been reduced .
u.s. federal reserve may cut the rate again
( washington , reuters ) rivlin , vice-chairman of the u.s. federal reserve board warned on monday that the global financial storm will cause a considerable slow-down in the u.s. economy . she also implied that another rate cut may be needed for the u.s. to avoid the economic recession .
rivlin said during an interview that she doesn &apos;t think the u.s. economy will collapse , but she warned that the reduced export volume and employment opportunities mean the economy will slow down substantially .
the federal reserve has cut the interest rate twice in the past six weeks so as to keep the u.s. economy from being affected by the severest financial storm in the past 50 years .
the federal reserve will meet on nov . 17 to discuss the rate cut .
the public guess is that the federal reserve will decide to cut the rate again to keep the economy stable .
the u.s. economic growth rate for the third quarter is only 3.3 % , lower than the 5.5 % for the first quarter .
it is predicted that the economic growth in the next few months will further slow down .
this is a result of the reduced u.s. export to asia which in turn affects the investment and output in the u.s. manufacturing industry .
rivlin pointed out , the tremendous pressure on the u.s. financial market has slightly eased up in the past few weeks .
however , she warned , tightened credit is still there .
rivlin thinks that the world economy is not out of crises yet .
the recovery in asia is still in its initial stage .
the economy in japan , the second largest economic entity in the world , has not yet recovered , while the economy in russia is &quot; still nasty . &quot;

( from kuala lumpur ) lien hoe is expected to redeem the current remaining 65 % of bonds or bonds with a total value of 53,810 million ringgit by the end of this year through financing bank loans .
lien hoe has issued redeemable indemnity bonds at 6 % apr that have a total value of 85,740,000 ringgit , and they matured on august 17 , 1998 .
due to the devaluation of the real estate market and tightened circulating funds , lien hoe was able to redeem only 35 % of the bonds on the maturity date , while the maturity date of the remaining 65 % of bonds is extended to august 17 , 2000 at 15 % apr .
lien hoe obtained the approval from the securities exchange supervision commission last month to extend the maturity date of its bonds to august 17 , 2000 . the group is also the first company in the country to have obtained approval to extend the maturity date of bonds .
as the interest rate has dropped in the current market , lien hoe plans to redeem the remaining bonds through bank loans in the hope that it will not have to pay the higher annual interest rate of 15 % to the bond holders .
zeng hualong , director and manager of the company , indicated that as the current interest rate has already dropped and the new financial budget bill is favorable to the development of the real estate industry , lien hoe is expected to turn the bad situation in the first half of the year by the second half of the year when it will achieve better performance .
assembly deputy in portugal requests for suharto &apos;s extradition
( lisbon , ap wire ) news from the attorney general &apos;s office of portugal said that the general prosecution office is studying a portuguese assembly deputy &apos;s request to extradite suharto , the former president of indonesia .
in his letter , assembly deputy keleiya xierwa said that suharto should be extradited for his violation of human rights in east timor .
in 1975 , indonesia invaded east timor , the former colony of portugal , and annexed east timor into indonesia &apos;s territory a few weeks later .
sala pina , a spokeswoman for the general prosecution office , said : &quot; we are studying right now to see if it can be done under portuguese laws . &quot;
human rights organizations denounced the indonesian military for its violation of human rights in east timor .
xierwa said , the recent case in which pinochet , the former dictator of chile , may be extradited to spain on charges of genocide and other crimes has further increased his determination to have suharto extradited .
at present , pinochet is in london , waiting for the upper house to make the decision whether he will be extradited .
the british supreme court repealed the initial warrant for pinochet &apos;s arrest by reason that as a former state leader , pinochet is entitled to immunity from suit .
xierwa is a member of popular party , a right-wing party in portugal .
he said , the united nations still regards portugal as the legitimate administrator of east timor , which facilitates their request for suharto &apos;s extradition .
philippine foreign minister : no hope for cambodia to join asean next month
( manila , afp wire ) philippine foreign minister siazon said the day before yesterday that there is no hope for cambodia to join asean during the summit meeting of chiefs of states from asean nations to be held next month in hanoi .
siazon said , even if the oppositions in cambodia form a coalition government before the summit meeting , it will not become a member nation of asean automatically .
he said : &quot; many asean member nations are still hesitating .
there are many problems at present , and the political process in cambodia is still going on .
if we accepted them as a new member now , we would have to tackle the problem anew if they started to fight again afterwards . &quot;
earlier this week , abdullah , foreign minister of malaysia , said that asean &apos;s acceptance of cambodia &apos;s membership will depend on whether it can establish a legitimate government .
siazon said : &quot; someone said , didn &apos;t we get burned once before ? we were just preparing for their membership when they started to fight again within a matter of only a few days . &quot;
obviously , he was referring to the events in april , 1997 when cambodia almost joined asean .
the main reason why cambodia &apos;s membership in asean fell through at that time was that hun sen overthrew prince ranariddh by force .
the people &apos;s party of cambodia led by hun sen won the election this july , yet the party was unable to gain the two-thirds majority of the parliamentary seats required for the single party administration .
last week , hun sen reached an agreement with ranariddh on forming a coalition government , but the new government has not really been established yet .
china plans to reclaim a million hectares of land from sea to settle down 20 to 30 million people in the next century
( beijing , afp wire ) the english newspaper &quot; china daily &quot; reported yesterday that china plans to reclaim the land from the sea in the coastal region so that 20 to 30 million people can be settled down in the next century .

china daily said that 20 to 30 million people will live in these regions in the next century .
the newspaper quoted prof. yu zhiying ( transliterated ) as saying : &quot; technically , there is no problem for china to achieve the goal of reclaiming the land from the sea . the problem is insufficient capital . &quot;
sources said that even if the plan would bring serious environmental problems , &quot; it is still the magic key to easing the shortage of land resources in the next century , especially in consideration of china &apos;s huge population . &quot;
projects associated with this plan can also promote new industries and provide new job opportunities .
china plans to invest in the infrastructure so as to cancel out the impact of the financial crisis in asia .
zuo zhongmo ( transliterated ) , deputy secretary-general of the conference , said : &quot; this is not merely an agricultural issue . the land can be used for comprehensive development in various fields , including forestry , industry and tourism . &quot;
although china is implementing a &quot; one-child policy , &quot; the population in china is expected to continue to grow until the mid 21st century when it will peak at 1.6 billion .
at present , china has a population of 1.23 billion .
over 90 % of the population concentrate on one-third of the land in the nation .
japanese prime minister hopes miyazawa will stay and implement plan to revive economy
( tokyo , reuters wire ) the japanese finance minister kiichi miyazawa was pressured yesterday to remain in office .
he announced last week that he intended to resign soon .
miyazawa &apos;s decision to leave or stay also casts some shadow upon the coalition government formed between the liberal democratic party led by prime minister keizo obuchi and the liberal party led by ichiro ozawa .
as soon as the senior officials &apos; disagreement surfaced over whether the cabinet seat for the liberal party is agreed upon , the coalition government fell into instability .
widespread rumor circulating outside the government has it that noda , secretary general of the liberal party , will replace miyazawa after he resigns .
miyazawa indicated last friday that he might resign by the end of the year , yet he did not give a specific date .
he said at the press conference : &quot; i can &apos;t say when . &quot;
it is expected that he will serve as minister of finance until the two-week special meeting of the diet is over .
the diet meeting will come to a close on dec . 14 .
suzuki , deputy cabinet secretary for keizo obuchi , told nhk tv that he believes the prime minister wants the 79-year-old miyazawa to stay in office .
suzuki said : &quot; i think ( obuchi ) privately wants him to stay to implement his plan to revive economy . &quot;
obuchi will talk with miyazawa in person .
he said : &quot; given his skills and talents , it is hard to find his replacement .
i myself hope that he will stay in office and commit himself to reviving the nation &apos;s economy . &quot;
the public comment obuchi made on miyazawa &apos;s decision to leave is that he has seen the reports concerning this and is planning to talk with the prime minister .
information minister rahmat : participants in &quot; don &apos;t let the fire die &quot; demonstration should not become puppets of foreign forces
( from kuala lumpur ) mohamed rahmat , information minister of malaysia , said that participants in &quot; don &apos;t let the fire die &quot; demonstration should not become puppets of foreign forces to sabotage the country , but instead should adopt wiser ways to express their wishes .
he said , to express one &apos;s wishes through rational means would be more effective than resorting to violence and disturbances .
malaysian national news agency reports that mohamed rahmat told the media yesterday after attending the family day activities organized by the ministry of information that the government has already taken measures to let people fully express what they think by setting up 500 &quot; centers for airing points of view &quot; in various parts of the country so that people can give their comments and opinions about their country through proper channels .
he said , the government will study the comments people give and how they feel so that improvements will be made to meet the needs of the general public .
this , he stressed , is the way things are done in a democratic country .
he also urged the demonstrators to ponder over the consequences the demonstration has brought , as the prosperity today is only made possible by the devotion to the country and positive construction by the people of the entire country ever since malaysia declared independence 41 years ago .
he said , as the demonstrators intensified their full-scale resistance against the government after they obtained the support from the foreign forces , they were not aware that it was an act of selling out their national dignity .
he indicated : &quot; if foreigners want to invest in malaysia , they are always welcome . yet , if they pay the demonstrators , we will surely protest . &quot;

the united states has expressed its concern over the riots in east timor . it has also quoted from the reliable resources that the recent military action has caused civilian casualties .
however , moore said that habibie refused to let sherman , former director of the national bureau of criminal investigation of australia , go to east timor to conduct investigations on the deaths of five australian journalists in 1975 .
after a new witness accused the current information minister yosfiah , who was commander of the indonesian special forces in 1975 , of ordering the soldiers to kill these australian journalists , the australian government has decided to resume investigations on this case .

the association of british immigrants appeals to the government to face up to this problem in the economic interests of the local immigrants as well as australia .

the british account for 14 % of the australian immigrant population .
however , the statistics from bureau of immigration show that from 1996 to 1997 , while 11,978 new british immigrants came to australia , 3,737 people left during the same period of time .
hante said , after the association itself conducted the survey in melbourne , it found that one-fourth of the british believe they are discriminated against in australia .
nearly 40 % of the people interviewed think the native australians favor non-british immigrants .
37 % point out that the complaints from the british immigrants do not get the same serious treatment that other ethnic groups are getting .
about 35 % of the people interviewed blame the media as the chief culprit for making the native australians prejudiced against the british immigrants .

the archdiocese of boston unexpectedly reversed its stance yesterday . the archdiocese now thinks the agreement imposed too much a financial burden after its financial consultants went through the settlement in details . the archdiocese does not think it can afford the settlement and therefore it will cancel the $ 20- $ 30 million deal made in march with the 86 victims claiming sexual molestation .
the finance council of the archdiocese said in a statement : &quot; this settlement would consume substantially all of the resources of the archdiocese that can reasonably be made available and therefore , such an action would leave the archdiocese unable to provide a just and proportional response to other victims . &quot;
according to the rejected settlement agreement , independent arbitrator will assess the injuries to victims case-by-case and severely injured may receive damages up to a million u.s. dollars . while , victims least injured may be given twenty five thousand u.s. dollars .

oecd ministers taking a glance into the future of global economy in paris
( agence france-presse , paris ) - the senior ministers of the world &apos;s major industrial countries are holding a two-day meeting in paris . they are portraying a promising long-term economy . however , they are also facing potential disagreements over trade disputes between u.s. and europe .
the delegates of the thirty member nations of organization for economic and co-operation and development ( oecd ) are also concerned about conflicts due to a narrowing gap between the rich and poor countries .
however , a discussion of macroeconomics may be overshadowed by the escalating trade disputes between u.s. and the european union .
the leaders of european union are extremely upset by a bill signed by bush on the 13th . that bill permits the u.s. government to increase subsidy to farmers by 70 % over the next 10 years .
european union officials believe the bill jeopardize u.s. commitment to terminate subsidy for agricultural export made last november during a ministerial meeting of world trade organization in doha , qatar .
&quot; when we talk loudly about free trades but are not committed to it , then it becomes a deceptive act , &quot; belgium prime minister guy verhofstadt said at a forum before the opening of ministerial meeting .
u.s. congressional elections may slow down the pace for free trade
( agence france-presse , washington ) - many economists and analysts fear that protectionist measures aimed to please voters of different electoral districts in the upcoming congressional elections may imperil u.s. long time efforts to promote free trades and globalization .
&quot; president bush decided to put political objective above the objective of a healthy u.s. economy , &quot; said jeff schott , an economist of a washington think tank , the institute for international economics .
he thinks president bush has submitted to pressure from the steel industry and the unions for employees in steel . he decided to levy tariffs targeted at several major supply sources , including european union , russia , japan and brazil -- for certain steel products , the tariffs is as high as 30 % .
in addition , bush also imposed 27 % anti-dumping customs tariffs on certain canadian lumbers , which are mainly used as building material . the reason given is that canadian government is subsiding the export of these lumbers and as such constitutes a dumping in u.s.
schott thinks that the &quot; farm bill &quot; recently passed by u.s. federal government is most critical . that bill increases the subsidy to certain agricultural products by nearly 80 % . such approach contradicts u.s. commitment made during trade talks last november in doha , the capital city of qatar .
in the doha meetings , u.s. maintained that trade liberation for agricultural products are necessary to help poor nations to export their agricultural products to markets in rich countries .
in return , developed countries can provide their products and services more easily to poor nations under the free trade environment .
schott thinks the u.s. farm bill is going to damage free trade and its harm is likely to exceed those caused by tariffs on import steel .

appeal court ruled the pledge of allegiance unconstitutional
( agence france-presse , san francisco , 27th ) - u.s. appeal court ruled the pledge of allegiance taken daily before lessons by american students was unconstitutional because it cites the name of god .
three judges in san francisco made the controversial ruling , which is likely to provoke hot debates amongst u.s. public .
for a long time in america , the relation of politics and religions has caused a lot of important debates .
the written verdict of the ninth circuit court of appeal pointed out that &quot; one nation under god &quot; shows a support for a religion , which is banned by constitution .
an atheist made an appeal to san francisco circuit court because his daughter has to recite the pledge of allegiance every morning in school .
his appeal was upheld .
citing a decision in supreme court , judge alfred goodwin pointed out schools cannot hold any religious prayer session in graduation ceremony and cannot force students to recite the pledge of allegiance .
the pledge of allegiance is taken by millions of primary school students between the ages of 5 to 11 every morning before lessons . they have to recite the pledge of allegiance with their right hands on their chests while facing a u.s. flag .
the controversial phase , &quot; under god &quot; , was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 when eisenhower was ruling .
the pledger must pledge allegiance to &quot; the flag of the united states of america and to the republic for which it stands , one nation , under god , indivisible with liberty and justice for all . &quot;
in u.s. , the separation of religions and politics has been a controversial issue . morning prayer session is banned in state-owned schools , which has already raised serious backlash in a country with devoted religious belief and patriotic feelings .
once the ruling becomes effective , it will affect the public schools in eight western states and the u.s. protected territory of guam and northern mariana islands .
the ruling is likely to be appealed in u.s. supreme court .
