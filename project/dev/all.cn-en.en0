delegates attending the un conference on world climate continue their work in the argentine capital of buenos aires .
meanwhile , the us congress is discussing whether or not to approve the protocol reached in the kyoto conference in japan .
another report filed by voa correspondent fulekus from buenos aires says several us congressmen have brought the debate to the meeting hall of buenos aires on tuesday .
here is the detailed report read by ma kaiyue :
us democratic senators liberman and kley announced their statement on tuesday in buenos aires , urging the clinton administration to ratify the protocol this week , which was reached at the kyoto conference .
the two senators said this will make us delegates more convincing in getting developing countries to promise to reduce emission of greenhouse gases .
this is actually a precondition set for several bills in the senate .
however , some us congressmen in buenos aires said they opposed any such actions taken by the clinton administration .
chairman of the house science committee , wisconsin republican s.s. brunne said the kyoto protocol is sure to be vetoed in the senate due to its fatal defects .
he said :
congressman s.s. brunne said that just as the protocol is being put aside right now , it would have become defunct before getting to the senate , and the us senate will not approve the protocol .
the question is what we should do now .
shall we try to save it or to declare that the protocol has fatal defects and we need to hold another discussion .
congressman s.s. brunne said this is not a party struggle in the senate and the congress , which was echoed by several prominent democratic congress members .
pennsylvanian democratic congressman kellink said he was opposed to the protocol because it would reduce the employment rate and the degree of us industrialization .
however , ohio democratic congressman kuczyn disagreed with s.s. brunne . he compared the fight against global warming with the struggle for world peace .
he said the same resolution will make the kyoto protocol a success .
he said :
congressman kuczyn said , i hope this process to go on and at the same time we cannot ignore the necessity of reaching a global solution simply because of the stubbornness of one congressman , with or without the us participation .
in the main meeting hall of buenos aires , delegates are discussing various topics , some of which will most probably be left to energy and environmental ministers of 160 attending countries to settle during wednesday &apos;s meeting .
us delegates said the conference has made headway though some issues , although some issues most concerned for by the us congress will probably be left for settlement till next year &apos;s conference .

the london-based tibetan information network said one of the most respected tibetan religious leaders , arja renboche , had fled to the united states in protest of china &apos;s policy towards tibet .
the tibetan information network said that arja renboche seemed to be indignant at beijing &apos;s attempt to carry out monastery reforms in the chaotic tibetan region and its refusal to accept the reincarnated soul boy , or the future panchen lama , designated by the dalai lama .
however , the tibetan information network said it was not clear if arja renboche plans to seek asylum in the united states .
a us arms control delegation , which is in beijing for talks to accelerate the process for china to join the missile technology control agreement , said china may still be exporting missile technology to other countries .
following is the summary report by voa correspondent fang yuan :
a us delegation led by acting under secretary of state holem held a one and a half day talks in beijing with chinese foreign minister tang jiaxuan , deputy chief of joint staff xiong guangkai and some other chinese arms control experts regarding china &apos;s participation in the missile technology control agreement .
the meeting concentrated on how to materialize chinese president jiang zemin &apos;s promise made in june when president clinton paid a visit to china .
jiang zemin promised at that time that china would consider joining the missile technology control agreement , which was seen as one of the major achievements in the china-us summit meeting .
one member of the us delegation told ap that the us side suspected that china was still exporting missile parts or missile technology and that pakistan and iran were two beneficiaries of china &apos;s missile technology export .
the official said the us side continued to raise the issue to china and he believed that china was taking measures to resolve these issues .
china &apos;s export of missile technology has remained an issue which often causes frictions in us-china relations .
following the nuclear tests earlier this year by both india and pakistan , the two arch rivals in the south asian subcontinent , the united states felt that it needs china in particular to make an undertaking regarding the control of missile technology transfer , because pakistan , one of the nuclear contestants in the south asian subcontinent , is a long-time ally of china .
as early as in 1993 , the united states had imposed sanctions on china for its export of missile parts and technology to pakistan . china only , the united states only lifted the sanctions in 1994 when china promised to stop its export of surface-to-surface missiles .
the united states also worries that the missile trade between china and iran will pose serious threats to us allies in the middle east and its own interests .
however , the official who disclosed the above declined to elaborate what kind of missile technology is being exported and when china provided such technology to pakistan and iran .
he said there was not enough evidence that china did provide missile technology to the two countries .
in the past , when the united states gathered evidence that china exported missile technology to the above two nations , china either denied the report or insisted it provided dual-use technology and only for peaceful purposes .
so far , the chinese side has not responded publicly to the remarks made by the us delegation official .
according to another ap report from beijing , washington has confirmed that it was north korea rather than china which helped pakistan to develop the &quot; korea &quot; missile which was launched in april .

in weather , we know the consequences resulted from the el nino phenomenon , including the persistent big fires in indonesia , the floods in the desert regions of peru and the extensive abnormality of regional weathers around the world .
in the united states , california and other southern states were flooded at the beginning of this year , followed by a drought in many places in the south .
experts say the el nino is becoming a new phenomenon called the la nina .
moreover , la nina will bring surprising consequences worse than the el nino phenomenon .
following is the report from chicago by voa correspondent li lan , read by qi zhifeng :
chicago , which usually has freezing winters , witnessed warmer weather and less snow last year and the next winter is likely to be the same .
meanwhile , el nino was rampant in southeast asia with a drastic decrease of precipitation , causing wild fire that has lasted for weeks and been out of control .
the el nino and la nina are the results of drastic temperature changes in the eastern pacific ocean .
el nino refers to the above-average temperatures of the water &apos;s surface , which affects the air current causing changes of world weather .
la nina refers to the below-average temperature of the tropical pacific ocean &apos;s surface , which has the opposite influences on the weathers of many places .
larve , an expert with the u.s. meteorological bureau , said that big fires in indonesia will not go out of control next year because the region is predicted to see more rain from this december to next march compared with the previous years .
meanwhile , western and southeastern africa will see lower temperatures and there will be more rain in the northern part of south america .
the southern part of the united states will be drier , which means taxes and new mexico will experience persistent drought while there are more chances of fire taking place in the forests of florida .
the torrential rain this year in california and its southern part is attributed to the el nino .
larve said the el nino will not result in rainstorms but will contribute to the forming of them .
the past summer was one of the hottest in the history of the united states .
some people link the world warming to the el nino phenomenon .
larve believes that it is possible but there has been no evidence so far .
however , whatever the reason is , the upcoming winter in the north and central west will be much colder and will see more snow .

ottawa citizen reports that canadian foreign trade minister marchi made the remarks on thursday in a meeting on foreign policy and trade held in ottawa .
marchi said what he saw in malaysia during the apec summit meeting and the arrests of dissidents by chinese authority had made him firmly believe that canada should export its goods together with its values .
human rights and social justice should become an important part of canada &apos;s foreign trade policy .
canadian news agency reported that the report by the foreign relations committee of canada &apos;s parliament suggests that the canadian government review various foreign aid projects in order to improve the human rights conditions of the recipient countries while helping to develop their economies .
the national post said that all signs indicated that the canadian government is trying to adjust its foreign policy towards asian countries including china . and the report of the senate foreign relations committee is only one of those signs .

these people can set examples and they can have direct influence over the improvement of local human rights conditions and the protection of employees .

the united states and north korea are scheduled to hold talks on friday regarding us access to a suspected underground nuclear site in the vicinity of pyongyang .
representatives from both sides will first hold a two-day talks in new york and then move to washington to continue their talks .

minister of china &apos;s state economic and trade commission , sheng huaren , said the chinese army and other governmental institutions will soon fully break off ties with their subordinate enterprises .
the resolution seems much firmer this time though the chinese government has issued such orders several times before .
following is the report by voa correspondent ning xin :
minister of china &apos;s state economic and trade commission , sheng huaren , said the chinese army will fully break ties with its subordinate businesses before december 20 .
other party , governmental and law enforcement authorities must take similar actions beginning from the start of next year .
in july , chinese president jiang zemin ordered the army and the armed police to stop running enterprises , hotels or other businesses to curb the increasing corruption and smuggling within the army .
sheng huaren said so far , some businesses in shanghai and tianjin had been put under the control to local governments . however , he did not say whether the army would be compensated .
apart from the army , all party , governmental and law enforcement authorities were also ordered not to run any subordinate businesses .
chinese state-owned enterprises have over 100 million workers . some of the enterprises are actually on the verge of bankruptcy due to bad debts and sluggish export markets caused by the global economic crisis .
sheng huaren said many overstaffed state-owned enterprises , which employ ten times as many personnel as they need , incurred greater losses during the past year .
this shows that it is an urgent task to strengthen their market competitiveness .
in addition , analysts say corruption and mismanagement are rampant in governmental in charge of state-owned enterprises and law enforcement departments .
it is very common for many officials , who act as regulators of an industry , to operate business in the same sector .
therefore , they can provide contracts , loans and favorable taxes to the businesses with their influences .
this phenomenon undermines fair market competition and hampers china &apos;s transformation from a planned economy to a market one .
it is reported that a newly-established committee under the state council will take charge of over 500 largest former state-owned enterprises affiliated to the party , governmental and law enforcement authorities . their employees will be arranged by personnel departments .
local governments will take charge of the smaller-sized businesses .
in addition , financial and investment companies will be controlled by the ministry of finance .
it is not clear now if these changes mean that the government will reduce its loans provided to the state-owned enterprises , causing some large-sized enterprises to gradually go bankrupt .
some analysts believe that due to worries about the social instability caused by high unemployment rate , china is likely to deal with the problem of enterprises suffering losses by merger rather than bankruptcy .

( apf report from lisbon ) according to reliable sources , portuguese foreign minister gama will hold talks with a un official in geneva on the issue of over-deployment of indonesian troops in east timor .
saiser , spokesman for gama , said what the relevant reports say are not in line with what was promised by indonesian foreign minister alatas in august before gama and un secretary-general koffi annan .
saiser said alatas had promised to gradually reduce indonesian troops in east timor .
sources said gama is scheduled to hold discussions with annan &apos;s representative mark regarding the relevant developments .
according to a file , obviously a confidential document of the indonesian military , which was circulated among foreign journalists , by the end of july , there were 17,834 indonesian military men in east timor .
western embassies said the number was very close to what they had estimated .
however , indonesian commander-in-chief wiranto rebuffed it as a &quot; lie &quot; .
he failed to give the true number but military officials had indicated that there were about 11,500 indonesian troops in east timor in august .
indonesia sent its troops to east timor in 1975 and annexed it in the following year .
however , the united nations still holds that lisbon shall be responsible for the administration of east timor .
the un secretary-general has been sponsoring peace talks between portugal and indonesia since 1983 .

us federal reserve may cut rates again
( reuters report from washington ) vice chairman of the us federal reserve rivlin warned on monday that the global financial crisis will slow down us economic growth , and hinted that the united states may need to further cut interest rates to avoid economic recession .
rivlin said in an interview that she didn &apos;t think the us economy would collapse but she warned that the decline of export and the reduction of employment opportunities mean that economic growth would slow down drastically .
the federal reserve had cut interest rates twice over the past six weeks to avoid the lash on us economy brought by the most severe financial crisis in half a century .
the federal reserve is scheduled to meet on november 17 to discuss about interest rate cut .
it is generally anticipated that the federal reserve will cut rates again to keep the economy stable .
the us economy saw a 3.3 % increase in the third quarter of the year , lower than the 5.5 % of the firs quarter .
it is predicted that the economy will further slow down in the coming several months .
this is because both investment and output of the american manufacturing industry have been affected by the decline of us export to asia .
rivlin pointed out that the great pressure on the us financial market had been relieved in the past few weeks .
however , she warned that the credit crunch still existed .
rivlin also said the world economy has not fully recovered from the crisis .
asia &apos;s recovery was in the very preliminary stage .
japan , the world &apos;s second largest economy , had not recovered while russia &apos;s economic situation &quot; remains bad &quot; .

( report from kuala lumpur ) lien hoe expected that by way of bank loans , it may redeem the currently remaining 65 % or 53,810,000 ringgit of its bonds , before the end of this year .
the redeemable secured bonds at an annual interest rate of 6 % issued by lien hoe had a total value of 85,740,000 ringgit , expiry on august 17 , 1998 .
due to the declining of the real estate market and the decrease of floating capital , lien hoe was able to redeem only 35 % of its bonds upon expiration , and the remaining 65 % of the bonds were deferred till august 17 , 2000 , at an annual interest rate of 15 % .
the securities exchange regulatory commission granted its approval last month that lien hoe could defer its bonds till august 17 , 2000 , which made the group the first company in the country to be approved for the deferral of bonds .
as the current market interest rate has gone down , lien hoe has planned to redeem the remaining bonds through bank loans , instead of the even higher annual interest rate to the bond holder , which is 15 % .
the managing director of the company , tseng hualong , said , as the current interest rate has gone down , and the newly proposed financial budget is advantageous to the development of the real estate industry , lien hoe was expected to be able to reverse the adverse situation in the first half of the year , and achieve good performance in the second half of the year .

( ap report from lisbon ) portugal &apos;s chief procurator &apos;s office said the day before yesterday that the general procuratorate is discussing a request raised by a portuguese parliament member to extradite former indonesian president suharto .
parliament member kreja silva said in a letter that suharto should be extradited for his deeds against human rights in east timor .
indonesia invaded east timor , a former portugal colony , in 1975 and annexed it to indonesia several weeks later .
spokeswoman of the general procuraorate sala pena said , &quot; we are studying the possibility of doing so on the basis of portuguese laws . &quot;
human rights organizations have accused indonesian troops &apos; violations of human rights in east timor .
silva said the possible extradition of pinochet , former chilean dictator , to spain for charges such as genocides had made him firmer on the extradition of suharto .
pinochet is now in london , awaiting the upper house &apos;s decision on his extradition .
britain &apos;s supreme court has revoked an order to arrest pinochet because pinochet enjoys immunity as a former head of state .
silva is a member of the rightist people &apos;s party .
he said the united nations still considers portugal the legal administer of east timor . this will be helpful for filing the request to extradite suharto .
philippine foreign minister : cambodia not expected to join asean next month
( apf report from manila ) philippine foreign minister siazon said the day before yesterday that cambodia was not expected to join asean during the asean summit next month in hanoi .
siazon said cambodia will not become an asean member automatically even if the cambodian opposition parties form a coalition before the summit meeting .
he said , &quot; many asean members showed hesitation . &quot;
&quot; now there still exist many problems and the political process in cambodia is under way . &quot;
&quot; if we accept them as a new member , we have to deal with the problem once again if they fight again . &quot;
earlier this week , malaysian foreign minister abdullah said cambodia &apos;s asean membership hinged on the establishment of a legitimate government .
siazon said , &quot; some say , haven &apos;t we been burnt before ? at that time , just as we were ready to accept them , they fought again several days later . &quot;
he was obviously referring to april 1997 when cambodia was close to reach an agreement to join asean .
cambodia &apos;s failure to join asean was due to the overthrow of prince ranariddh by hun sen.
hun sen &apos;s cambodian peoples &apos; party won the election in july but the party failed to win over 2 / 3 parliament seats required for its sole control of the government .
last week , hun sen and ranariddh reached an agreement to form a coalition government , but the new government is yet to be established .

xinhua news agency report of september 1 from nanjing ( by staff reporter yuan yanghe ) - professor liu yuyi , who once created a sensation in the arts circle with his renowned painting of &quot; a merry eve &quot; , recently exhibited his collection of a yuhua stone in nanjing , which he called the &quot; rare stone of the divine land with five unique features &quot; .
the shape and size of the yuhua stone are very similar to the auspicious longevity padlock .
the center of the yuhua stone bears an image which very much resembles the territory of the people &apos;s republic of china .
the image rises in both ends , sunken in the middle and protrudes in the lower right portion , just like a crowing cock standing upright ; beside the &quot; cock &apos;s &quot; stomach and across a &quot; strait &quot; lies a narrow &quot; taiwan island &quot; ; and below the &quot; cock &apos;s &quot; claws lies the round &quot; hainan island &quot; .
the color of the two islands is identical with that of the &quot; mainland &quot; .
the entire image is very similar to a chinese map .
professor liu yuyi said that he found this yuhua stone five years ago along the road to a yuhua stone processing plant . after careful study , he noticed the &quot; chinese territory &quot; on the stone .
at the same time , he also found a huge dragon with a shining pearl in its mouth above the mainland territory and along china &apos;s northeastern , northern and northwestern borderlines . above the giant dragon , there is a golden flare like a shoe-shaped gold ingot . in the middle of the mainland territory there are a series of torch-like stripes , a symbol of never-extinguishing fire of life of the chinese nation . these features , together with the shape of the stone like a longevity padlock , add up to a total of five unique features with this stone .
liu yuyi thus called this stone the &quot; rare stone of the divine land with five unique features &quot;

nets and pistons advanced to second round of nba eastern conference
( afp , washington ) on thursday , the new jersey nets again survived the desperate outbursts of the indiana pacers &apos; clutch player miller to beat the pacers 120-109 after the second overtime , winning the critical game 5 in the first round of the nba playoffs and advancing to the second round .
the detroit pistons were also advanced after edging out the toronto raptors in game 5 .
the pistons did not perform well in this game . it was not until stackhouse made a sideline jumper , 1 minute 43 seconds before time expired , that the team gained an 85-82 lead , claiming its first victory in a playoff series in 11 years .
in the game in new jersey , nets shooter kidd scored a new career playoff high with 31 points . in addition , he had 8 rebounds and 7 assists , creating numerous scoring opportunities for the nets , which is the top-seeded team in the eastern division .
this is only the second time that the nets have entered the second round since the team was founded . they will take on the charlotte hornets , the fifth-seeded team , in the best-of-seven semi-final that starts on sunday .
however , it was miller who received the biggest spotlight in the game . after his excellent performance in the playoffs , he was again spectacular , nearly making the eighth-seeded pacers a breakout team .
he scored a shot right before the buzzer in regulation to tie the score . his basket was one of the most spectacular final critical baskets in the history of the playoffs , forcing the game into overtime . a moment later , he caught the nets off guard and dribbled to the basket for a dunk , bringing the score to a tie again and sending the game into the second overtime .
the nets , led by kidd , displayed great resilience and won in the end by 11 points .
miller scored a total of 31 points during the game , yet he was tightly guarded and held scoreless in the second overtime .
church pulled out settlement with victims over boston priest &apos;s sexual abuse scandal
( afp , boston , massachusetts ) after the case of the pedophile boston catholic priest geoghan was brought to light , a multimillion-dollar settlement was originally reached between the archdiocese of boston and the victims in the hope that the pending litigation might be resolved out of court . however , the church suddenly pulled out of the settlement . dozens of alleged geoghan victims are now considering legal countermoves .
the position of the archdiocese of boston yesterday came as an unexpected dramatic reversal . they claimed their financial advisors found that the church , already in financial straits , is unable to bear the burden . therefore , they will cancel the march settlement ranging from 20 million us dollars to 30 million us dollars reached with 86 alleged victims of pedophilia .
the archdiocese &apos;s finance council issued a statement saying : &quot; the proposed settlement would consume substantially all the resources the archdiocese can reasonably have access to . therefore , such an action would leave the archdiocese unable to provide a fair and proportional response to other victims . &quot;
under the cancelled settlement agreement , victims &apos; damages will be assessed by a disinterested mediator based on individual cases . payments may reach as much as a million us dollars for the most severely abused victims to 25,000 us dollars for the less severely abused victims .
the archdiocese &apos;s finance council thinks that this agreement may force the catholic archdiocese of boston into bankruptcy as the cases of the alleged sexual abuse keep surfacing , and on the other hand , &quot; the situation has changed dramatically since the process leading to the agreement started . &quot;
the 66-year-old geoghan was recently sentenced to 10 years &apos; imprisonment for his sexual molestation of a 10-year-old boy in 1991 .
the defrocked priest also faces other criminal trials and scores of civil lawsuits .
us and india to conduct first joint military exercise in mid-may in 4 decades
( afp , new delhi ) the united states and india will conduct their first joint military exercise in 39 years to mark a milestone in the cooperation between the two largest democracies in the world .
the ministry of national defense said that in mid-may , an elite brigade of indian paratroopers will conduct a joint military exercise with the special forces of the us pacific command near the renowned taj mahal .
the air forces from the two nations will provide support .
the ministry of national defense said it will be the first of the many military exercises to be conducted by the two nations .
the relations between the united states and india were strained during the cold war era . however , the situation has been dramatically improved since the sept.11 terrorist attacks in new york and washington d.c.
apart from patrolling the sea with the us navy in the strait of malacca between indonesia and malaysia so as to prevent any acts of piracy , india in recent years has also conducted joint military exercises with britain , france and japan .
a spokesman from the ministry of national defense of india said : &quot; the upcoming exercise aims at further enhancing the military cooperation between india and the united states . &quot;
the last time india conducted a joint military exercise with the united states was a year after a brief border war between india and china in 1962 .
since last july , about 50 us policy makers have visited india while about an equal number of people from india , including prime minister vajpayee and his national security team , paid visits to washington d.c.
after the sept.11 terrorist attacks , and the attack on the national parliament in new delhi last december that led to military tensions between india and pakistan , there have been increased contacts between the united states and india .
the diplomat said that the national defense policy makers in the united states and india decided on the mid-may military exercise in february partly because they also wanted to ease new delhi &apos;s discomfort over the strengthening relationship between the united states and pakistan .
south african space tourist back to earth after his space travel
( afp , moscow ) south african space tourist shuttleworth was back to earth on the 5th . the russian spacecraft he had boarded undocked smoothly from the international space station at 7 : 31 a.m. taipei time and successfully landed on the steppe in northwestern kazakhstan in central asia at 11 : 51 .
shuttleworth is the second paying space tourist in history after the american citizen tito .
both he and tito paid 20 million us dollars for their chance of space travel .
shuttleworth boarded a russian spacecraft on april 25 to enter space where he stayed for 10 days to conduct a series of medical and biological science experiments .
returning together with shuttleworth to earth are the russian spacecraft commander gidzenko and the italian engineer vittori who entered space with him .
after the spacecraft landed on terra firma , shuttleworth and his two partners will be first given a physical exam before boarding a helicopter to fly to astana in kazakhstan where they will be transferred to the russian capital moscow on the same day .
shuttleworth , who just turned 28 this year , is a very wealthy computer information businessman . he paid 20 million us dollars for this space trip , fulfilling his dream of a 10-day space travel .
the first space tourist in human history is tito , a businessman who turned 60 this year . he went on his space travel as a paying tourist in april last year .
the russian medical specialists pointed out earlier that shuttleworth is more suitable for space travel than tito .
during this space travel , he conducted a number of scientific experiments at the international space station , including a study on aids pathogens .
shuttleworth &apos;s space travel has drawn great publicity in south africa and won the honor of being the most important news event since mandela &apos;s release from prison .
us government not impressed by castro &apos;s goodwill stance to carter
( afp , washington ) the us president bush &apos;s administration is not impressed by the goodwill stance the cuban president castro has extended to former us president carter who is making a landmark visit to the communist island nation cuba .
castro expressed his willingness to allow carter to meet freely with dissidents and visit all areas , including those labs that washington has alleged are manufacturing key biological weapon components .
the white house and the state department said these proposals are meaningless .
the us state department spokeswoman cassel said : &quot; president carter is visiting cuba as a private citizen . he has not been sent there to inspect possible facilities of chemical or biological weapons . &quot;
her brief remark seems to echo the response of other commentators who pointed out that neither carter nor the other members of his delegation have any science background necessary for a proper inspection of the labs .
carter insisted that there was no mention of the us concern over cuba &apos;s plan for biological weapons while he was briefed by the government officials , but the us secretary of state powell indicated he did not believe this .
powell told abc network : &quot; i don &apos;t know what briefing president carter was given . i am certain that we have no reservation
about our belief that cuba possesses the research capabilities for biological warfare . &quot;
napster ceo hilbers resigns
( afp , san francisco ) napster , the once all-popular company for free music downloading , said that its chief executive hilbers has resigned , effective immediately .
it is still unknown at present who will be hilbers &apos; replacement .
napster &apos;s music website has remained closed as of today ever since the court ruled last year that its service had given rise to wide-spread copying .
after napster &apos;s music website was shut down , many other websites have taken its place .
the redwood city , california-based napster stated : &quot; we deeply regret that we haven &apos;t got a solution to funding yet that would enable napster to launch a service to benefit artists and website users . &quot;
it went on to say : &quot; we will take measures in the coming week to further cut expenses . &quot;
hilbers , once an executive officer of the german media giant bertelsmann , took the position of napster ceo at a time when bertelsmann started to help the struggling napster to continue its operation within the framework of the court ruling .
oecd ministers examine outlook of world economy in paris
( afp , paris ) senior ministers from the major industrial nations in the world met in paris on the 15th for a 2-day meeting . they will examine the future of a promising economy as well as confront the looming division caused by the trade dispute between the united states and europe .
representatives from the 30 member nations of the organization for economic cooperation and development will also concern themselves with the conflict arising from the efforts of rich and poor nations as they abridge the gap between them .
however , the discussion on macroeconomics may be eclipsed by the escalating trade friction between the united states and the european union .
leaders from the european nations expressed their indignation on a bill signed by president bush on the 13th that will allow the government to increase its subsidies to the us farmers by 70 % over the next decade .
the eu officials think the bill violates the promise the united states made at the wto ministerial conference held in doha , capital of qatar , last november on terminating its farm export subsidies .
at the forum prior to the opening ceremony of the ministerial meeting , belgian prime minister verhofstadt said : &quot; it is hypocritical to talk with eloquence about the market liberalization yet fail to implement it . &quot;
mid-term election may slow down us efforts to promote free trade
( afp , washington ) economists and analysts say that many of the additional trade barriers imposed to woo voters in all constituencies in the mid-term election may slow down the ever ongoing us efforts to promote global free trade .
economist schott from the institute for international economics , a washington think tank , said : &quot; us president bush is determined to put the political goal above that of promoting a sound us economy . &quot;
the bush administration , said he , succumbing to pressures from the steel industry and its labor union , levies a tariff of as high as 30 % on certain steel products from a number of major suppliers , including the eu , russia , japan and brazil .
in addition , bush also imposes an anti-dumping tariff of 27 % on a certain kind of lumber from canada to be used as building material on the ground that the canadian government &apos;s export subsidies on the lumber have constituted dumping .
schott said , what is more aggravating is that in the recently promulgated &quot; farm bill , &quot; the us federal government has increased subsidies on certain farm products by nearly 80 % , grossly violating the promise the united states made in the trade negotiations held last november in doha , capital of qatar .
at doha conference , the united states insisted on the liberalization of farm trade so as to help facilitate the access of farm products of poor nations into the markets of rich nations .
correspondingly , under the free trade , developed nations will also find it easier to provide poor nations with their products and services .
the damage of this us farm bill to the free trade , said schott , has far surpassed the damage brought about by the measure of imposing tariffs on steel imports .
us government officials defend government &apos;s handling of warnings of terrorist attacks
( afp , washington ) senior us officials scrambled to defend the government &apos;s handling of the warnings prior to the sept.11 terrorist attacks , the reports alleged , that included the warning that terrorists under osama bin laden might hijack us commercial airlines .
secretary of defense rumsfeld insisted in nbc &apos;s today show that president bush &quot; did what he should , namely , to go all out to pursue the global terrorist organizations and do everything in his power to deal with the nations that harbor these terrorists . &quot;
he said that terrorists &quot; may attack at any time and by any means available . it would be practically impossible to protect all locations at all times . &quot;
us vice president cheney , on the other hand , warned the democrats last night &quot; to be extra cautious and not to seek political interests by making incendiary remarks such as saying the white house had received advance information and could have prevented the bloody sept . 11 attacks . &quot;
after the white house admitted on the night of the 15th that bush had received the warning prior to the sept . 11 terrorist attacks that terrorists might hijack us commercial airplanes , the government came under fire .
british airways posts first annual loss in 15 years
( afp , london ) as reported by british airways , although the amount of loss is smaller than expected , british airways has posted its first annual loss since its privatization 15 years ago .
in the previous fiscal year that ended at the end of march , british airways &apos; pre-tax loss is £ 200 million ( 320 million euros or 290 million us dollars ) against a restated profit of £ 150 million the preceding year .
in the fourth quarter alone , british airways lost £ 85 million , compared with a loss of £ 65 million a year ago .
the former state-owned british airways blamed the poor performance on the sept . 11 terrorist attacks of last year , a global economic slowdown , and the foot-and-mouth disease which kept foreign tourists away from britain .
the annual dividend , said british airways , was thus scrapped .
eddington , the airline &apos;s chief executive , said : &quot; the airline market is expected to remain weak but the quick and decisive actions we have taken have shown we are determined to return the business to acceptable levels of profitability . &quot;
however , the result still beat the market expectation that british airways would lose even more .
in the early trading session at the stock market , the ba shares rose 2.6 % to 241.75 pence .
this price was 8 % down from the price shortly before the september 11 attacks ; yet compared with the highest price of 760 pence in may 1997 , it was down by almost 70 % .
bush : us not to lift embargo until cuba holds free elections
( afp , washington ) us president bush said that only if cuba holds elections &quot; that can be proved to be free and fair &quot; and promotes the reform in the economic system will the united states lift the 41-year-old embargo against cuba .
bush said in a speech at the white house : &quot; only till then will i work with the us congress to remove the embargo on the trade and travel between the united states and cuba . &quot;
he said : &quot; trade with cuba will only help castro . &quot;
former us president jimmy carter went to cuba for a week &apos;s visit and called for the united states to lift the embargo in this only communist country in the americas .
merely 48 hours after he returned to the united states , bush made this most recent speech of his on cuba .
bush proposed in his speech to step up the humanitarian assistance to cuba and reach agreements directly with the cuban people through non-governmental agencies .
he also indicated that the united states will hold negotiations with cuba on resuming direct mail service between the two countries .
the issue has so far been consistently rejected by the cuban government .

bush arrives in russia for historic summit
( afp , moscow ) us president bush arrived in moscow today to hold a historic summit on new arms reduction measures and on shaping a 21st-century partnership between the two nations who were once bitter foes .
while moscow is preparing in a grand style for the first visit from president bush , the entire russian capital has stepped up security . one newspaper even cautions the muscovites to watch for the us secret service snipers .
ms. khakamada , a liberal member of the state duma , said : &quot; i am very optimistic , not only because of the documents that we expect to sign , but also because of the real , mutual economic interests finally unfolding . &quot;
she said : &quot; for the first time , the kremlin is leading the foreign policy instead of following the public opinion polls that still do not trust the united states . &quot;
bush and putin will hold their first meeting on the 24th and will sign at the kremlin the first nuclear arms reduction treaty in a decade , along with a border strategic partnership agreement before the meeting concludes .
the arms reduction treaty is the result of painstaking mutual efforts that once threatened to fail yet succeeded just now .
it stipulates that both sides reduce nuclear arms by two-thirds over the next decade , maintaining their nuclear warheads between 1,700 and 2,200 respectively .
the leaders of the two countries will also sign documents to reinforce their unexpectedly strong cooperation in a war against terrorism and a key policy paper aimed at coordinating their energy policies .
rogozin , chairman of state duma &apos;s foreign affairs committee , said : &quot; for the first time , we are moving from relations based on deterrence to a real partnership based on equality . &quot;
pakistan succeeds in test-firing second missile
( afp , islamabad ) in the wake of the first missile test yesterday that has drawn international condemnation that the test would intensify the tensions with the neighboring india , pakistan again succeeded in test-firing its second anti-ballistic missile today .

we are preparing for war .

japanese sporting goods firm bankrupt due to poor sales of world cup merchandise
( afp , tokyo ) a former employee said while the world cup fever continues to rage through japan , a small japanese sporting goods firm has been forced onto the path to bankruptcy for owing the huge license fee for manufacturing the world cup goods .
crix yasuda , a firm located in tokyo , applied to the court for bankruptcy protection on may 8 due to poor sales of the 20 items of its promoted merchandise featuring a world cup mascot logo , including bags and whistles .
the former company employee , who declined to be named , said : &quot; our company has gone bankrupt as piles of the world cup mascot goods sit in our warehouse . we could not pay the license fee of 50 million yen ( 400,000 us dollars ) to fifa . &quot;
the employee said : &quot; we entrusted a chinese company to manufacture the goods in china and started to sell the merchandise in japan in may last year .
now the world cup fever is raging , but our company went bankrupt even before the fever arrived . &quot;
established in 1932 , crix yasuda marketed soccer gear , including boots and kit . it employed a total of 12 employees .
a figure for the company &apos;s liabilities was not immediately available .
fifa &apos;s 2002 world cup mascots are the blue , purple and yellow spheriks respectively named nik , kaz and ato , but the mascots have failed to win the favor of the public in japan .
the world cup soccer tournament jointly hosted by japan and south korea will start on may 31 .
according to the official fifa website , the names of the players nik and kaz , and the coach ato were chosen in a vote by soccer fans from all over the world , but the association between the names above and the soccer is obscure .
fifa and south korea &apos;s and japan &apos;s organizing committees for the world cup started a full-scale campaign with much fanfare to promote the above mascots generated by computer 3d animation technology in december 1999 .
pakistan &apos;s president to make a speech on imminent threat of war
( afp , islamabad ) since pakistan &apos;s missile tests on the weekend have escalated the tensions between pakistan and india , pakistan &apos;s president musharraf is scheduled to make a national televised speech tonight on the imminent threat of war between the two nations and explain the actions his government will take in response to this situation .
pakistan , having indicated it would conduct a series of missile tests from the 25th to the 28th , has ignored the international appeal for restraints and test-fired two types of missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads--a &quot; ghauri &quot; medium-range missile capable of penetrating india and a newly-developed &quot; ghaznavi &quot; short-range missile .
international leaders led by us president bush have shown concerns over the missile tests . bush , however , indicated he is more concerned that &quot; musharraf demonstrates some results ( in the global war on terrorism ) . &quot;
speaking about musharraf &apos;s prevention of the cross-border incursion into india-controlled kashmir , bush said : &quot; he must show his efforts . &quot;
the cross-border incursion into indian-administered kashmir by pakistani radicals has already intensified the dispute between these two nuclear powers , resulting in a dangerous border stand-off .
in order to prevent the conflict from breaking out between these two hostile south asian nations , the international community is intensifying its diplomatic moves . deputy russian foreign minister saltanov is scheduled to arrive on a peace mission here today .
saltanov will discuss russian president putin &apos;s proposal .
besides the meeting to be held at alma ata , capital of kazakhstan , from june 3 through june 5 , putin indicated he is willing to arrange a face-to-face meeting between pakistani and indian leaders .
pakistan already indicated that it will &quot; make a positive response &quot; to this proposal aimed at cooling down india-pakistan dispute .
india , however , responded more cautiously , only indicating that prime minister vajpayee will pay a visit to alma ata , yet with no clarification whether the indian and pakistani leaders will meet .

they pointed out that at present , nearly 4 million tons of food must be imported to meet the minimum needs of food while 1.2 million tons of food must be made immediately available for emergencies .

this law criminalizes both wrong business decisions and capital flight .
multitudes of people both in the capital and the suburbs supported this protest , congregating finally in front of the congress building . many educational institutions as well as some airports also joined the general strike in protest .
interior ministers of european nations met for discussion on establishment of eu border police force
( afp , rome ) interior ministers from the 15 eu nations and other 13 european nations met on the eve of summit of all european nations to discuss the establishment of a eu border police force to tackle the issue of illegal immigrants .
italian interior minister scajola said interior ministers of these eu nations and the other 13 eu-candidate nations will focus their discussion on the finding of a study regarding the establishment of a common police force to guard the eu exterior border .
scajola said the top priority of this police force will be to guard all the airports . these airports , said he , are exactly the main passages through which most of illegal immigrants enter the eu territory .
in an interview with italian news agency , he said : &quot; according to our analysis , the airports are obviously the main passages to enter the territory and are therefore the places at the highest risk . &quot;
scajola said it is of top priority to coordinate their various different police forces if the nations want to ensure the security of the eu .
he said : &quot; our final goal is not necessarily to establish a single european police force but rather to facilitate an exchange of data and information among ourselves while standardizing police training . &quot;
experts gathering here pointed out that there are still difficulties for europe to establish a common border police force , but the main reason lies in the political and legal barriers that exist between the eu nations on one hand and the eu-candidate nations on the other .
the interior ministers attending the 4-hour conference today will discuss the 15 short , medium and long-term moves in hopes of reinforcing europe &apos;s porous border , including international airports .
us assesses worst consequence of india-pakistan nuclear war could be loss of millions of lives
( afp , washington ) citing the confidential assessment report from the pentagon , a us defense official pointed out that if a nuclear war broke out between india and pakistan , the worst scenario would be the loss of lives ranging from 9 million to 12 million . that figure could merely be the instant death toll resulting from the nuclear war , not including the deaths from diseases , starvation and polluted water supplies that accompanied the war .
recently , the relations between india and pakistan in south asia have been growing more and more tense over the disputed kashmir . as a result , the us defense intelligence updated this classified assessment report last week .
the official , who declined to be named , said that under the worst circumstances , in a short period of time &quot; the death toll could range from 9 ( million ) to 12 million , and another 2 ( million ) to 6 million could be injured . &quot;
he said : &quot; in the long run , all those things such as starvation , polluted water supplies and birth defects could happen . &quot;
the us official said the likelihood of the above scenario is based on the assumption that the number of nuclear weapons on each side matches the number of their targets while all weapons are successfully launched , resulting in surface explosions and dispersion of radioactive dust clouds .

he said : &quot; after sept . 11 , anyone would by instinct not fail to watch out more closely for certain types of people . &quot;
austin said : &quot; if an arab comes to my shop hoping to attend a class for scuba diving , i will not take him after careful consideration ; however , if he starts to look for large quantities of diving equipment , i will report to the appropriate authorities . &quot;

reynolds tobacco company fined 20 million us dollars for illegal ads
( afp , san diego , california ) california officials said that reynolds , the no. 2 us tobacco company , has been fined 20 million us dollars by a san diego judge for running cigarette ads in magazines in an illegal attempt to lure youths aged from 12 to 17 into smoking .
the ruling judge prager said under the terms of the 1998 agreement signed by the 46 us states , tobacco companies are barred from running cigarette ads in popular teenager magazines and from targeting youths .
some time earlier , three tobacco companies , the makers of camel , winston and salem , violated the terms ; yet reynolds still followed suit and did not scale down in any way the cigarette ad campaign targeting the youths .
the california &apos;s attorney general lockyer served as the prosecutor in this case . after three weeks of trial , the ruling judge ordered reynolds to pay a fine of 20 million us dollars in addition to all attorney and litigation fees .
in the future , reynolds must also take specific measures to effectively comply with the 1998 agreement .
the 1998 master settlement agreement bans running cigarette ads on bulletins and buses as well as limits the size of other cigarette ad bulletins . in addition , it restricts the giant cigarette makers from paying the media to promote their products or sponsoring youth sports games .
lockyer said while other tobacco companies have long agreed not to advertise in magazines with over 15 % readership of youth aged from 12 to 17 , reynolds has been reluctant to do so .
it was only a month ago that a los angeles court fined reynolds 14.8 million us dollars for handing out free cigarettes worth over 100,000 us dollars at events in which children also participated .
us labor department report on employment rate shows economy is recovering but at a slow pace
( afp , washington ) according to a us government report , there are signs that the us job market is recovering , although the pace of recovery is extremely slow , indicating the overall us economy is still struggling out of recession .
labor department said , in may there was an increase of about 41,000 job opportunities in the united states , while the unemployment rate dropped by 0.2 % to 5.8 % .
this is the biggest increase in non-farm job opportunities since february 2001 and is also the second straight month in the increase of employment following 12 consecutive months of steady decrease of employment .
unemployment rate is lower than wall street expected , but the number of newly-created job opportunities is smaller than many expected . according to economists , the newly created job opportunities are not enough to significantly promote the economic growth .
analysts said only a robust increase in job opportunities can lead to consumer spending , which in turn promotes the economic growth .
naroff of naroff economic advisors said the report from the labor department is surely good news , but it is just not good enough .
although there is an increase in job opportunities , the pace of increase is just yet too slow .
mubarak : creation of a palestinian state key to peace in the middle east
( afp , washington ) egyptian president mubarak insisted that the creation of a palestinian state under us pressure will help to achieve peace in the middle east , but us president bush refused to offer a specific timetable for the creation of the palestinian state .
in an exclusive videotaped interview with cbs , mubarak said : &quot; to establish a palestinian state right beside israel is the best guarantee for peace to both sides . &quot;
he said : &quot; we must find solutions to this plan , otherwise we will be in a mess . &quot;
last weekend mubarak and bush met at camp david to discuss the mideast crisis .
today bush met with israeli prime minister sharon at the white house to hold further talks on the mideast crisis .
bush is trying to finalize the us government &apos;s mideast policy and to lay the foundation for an international peace conference in the coming few months .
mubarak added in an exclusive video-taped interview with fox news : &quot; the united states is the key to the peace process in the middle east . &quot;
the egyptian president thinks that both israeli and palestinian peoples need the united states to help them reach an agreement . if israel and palestine are left alone to solve the problem , &quot; they will accomplish nothing . &quot;
he pointed out that the conflict in northern ireland is the best example of success when the us mediation resulted in an agreement by both parties involved in the conflict .
mubarak also called for bush to pass the message to sharon : &quot; destruction , use of force , slaughter and revenge will never bring about peace . &quot;

the conference &apos;s eleventh-seeded ferrero , who did not seem to be in his best shape in the game , played in a somewhat awkward way . although he tried his hardest to fight back , he had to come to terms with his second place due to his double faults as well as excessive unforced errors and frequently broken serves .
ferrero sprained his ankle in the first and second rounds of the men &apos;s singles .
it is the first time for both costa and ferrero to have entered the grand slam . this is also the 12th tournament title costa has won in his career as a professional tennis player .

costa fought his way all through to the tournament final , successively beating the brazilian tennis king kuerten the iron man and corretja , the spaniard player on red clay who won the second place at the french open last year . winning the crown at this french open will move costa &apos; ranking in the world way up to the 2nd .
this is costa &apos;s 26th try for a grand slam title . when there is a will , there will be a way . he has now finally fulfilled his wish of returning home with his championship trophy . before this , even when he was at his best at the grand slam , he never went beyond the quarterfinals in which he played at the french open respectively in 1995 and 2000 , and the australian open in 1997 .

masaru hayami pointed out : &quot; it is difficult to accurately assess the impact of the world cup on japan &apos;s economy . however , since the tournament is held at a time when economic activities in japan are just starting to show signs of recovery , i think it will be the factor supporting this trend . &quot;

meanwhile , masaru hayami noted that bank of japan will continue to monitor closely whether the recent positive sign in the manufacturing industry will expand to other industries such as household appliances and non-banking industries .
although the us stock market fluctuates due to its uncertainty whether capital spending and consumer spending are sustainable , masaru hayami said : &quot; i think the us economy is on its way to recovery . &quot;
masaru hayami warned : &quot; however , we must watch closely for any development in the us capital spending and consumer spending . &quot;
bank of japan upgraded its economic assessment for the fourth consecutive month during the last six months and noted that japan &apos;s economy will start to recover as a result of the increase in exports and acceleration in production .
ruling party in south korea faces huge obstacles after setback in local elections
( afp , seoul ) following the crushing defeat in last week &apos;s local elections and the embezzlement scandals involving the two sons of president kim dae-jung who founded the party , millennium democratic party , the ruling party in south korea , is heading toward a break-up .
the reformists attribute the major setback in elections suffered by the mdp on the 13th to the scandals involving kim dae-jung &apos;s aide and sons . now they hope to establish a new political party .
during this election , the opposition party , grand national party , scored a sweeping victory in major provinces and cities , which is yet another most recent sign that kim dae-jung &apos;s reputation is on the decline .
the result of an opinion poll released today in korean central daily shows that of the 60 mdp members of national assembly interviewed , 42 are in favor of founding a new party to be headed by roh moo-hyun , the party &apos;s presidential candidate .
a senior member of national assembly said : &quot; we must work harder to draw a clear line between the party and the president . &quot;
at present , the mdp is still under the control of kim dae-jung &apos;s long-trusted followers and key aides .
however , roh moo-hyun has vowed to reform the mdp . pundits predict he will change the name of the party and distance it from kim dae-jung .
kim dae-jung withdrew from the party last month , claiming he hopes to stay above the limitations of the party during his last few months in office .
us and south korea to hold high-level talks on resumption of dialogs between washington and pyongyang
( afp , seoul , june 17 ) officials said that just as signs are showing that the united states is getting ready to resume dialogs with north korea , south korea will send a senior security official to washington this week to hold high-level talks with the united states .
chong wa dae indicated that yim sung-joon , presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security , will meet with the us national security advisor rice on the 20th in washington .
it is expected that the upcoming resumption of dialogs between the united states and north korea will be the main topic of discussion in rice &apos;s talks with yim sung-joon .
south korean officials said they believe that the united states will soon resume substantial dialogs with pyongyang .
the us special envoy pritchard will meet with north korean officials in new york and discuss his possible trip to north korea .
a chong wa dae official said : &quot; we will hold a high-level talk with the united states at the time when the united states is going to reopen dialogs with north korea . &quot;
&quot; we can offer the united states our experience in talks between south and north koreas and confirm the us position on dialogs with north korea . &quot;
south korea has been actively seeking to reach a reconciliation with north korea so as to eliminate the stand-off between the two sides since the 1950-53 korean war . it has also requested the united states to resume dialogs with north korea .
when leaders in both south and north koreas held a historic summit in june 2000 , both sides reached agreements on a number of peace plans .
however , the reconciliation process between south and north koreas was stalled last year as president george w. bush adopted a hardline position on north korea after he took office .

( afp , islamabad ) the pakistani military warned sunday that after an unarmed pakistani soldier was allegedly tortured and shot to death , tensions between pakistan and its nuclear rival india again escalated .
the military spokesman major general qureshi said , although there has been some progress in easing the tensions between india and pakistan , it has gone up in smoke because of this incident . if india does not punish those involved , it may be accused of state-sponsoring a killing .
qureshi told afp : &quot; no matter what cosmetic actions india has taken , they have not reduced the tensions at all . &quot;
he was referring to the recent diplomatic and military maneuvers by india aimed at easing the crisis .
he added : &quot; this sufficiently shows that tensions are exactly what they were a month ago or a few months back .
there is no letting up in tensions at all . &quot;
qureshi said there has been no official response from india yet after pakistan called for india to investigate the death of the pakistanian soldier maqsood .

if the government is not involved in this incident , the government must take actions against the perpetrators . &quot;

750 dead or missing in floods in china
( afp , beijing ) floods have devastated large areas in china . according to official statistics , over 750 have been killed or missing . a rescue agency pointed out that many victims live in the poorest areas in the country .
the most recent statistics released by the ministry of civil affairs of china show that 453 have been confirmed dead in the floods in 8 provinces and cities . in the worst-hit shaanxi province , 151 have been confirmed dead .
these figures do not include the additional number of 300 people believed to be missing in shaanxi province . jia zhibang , the province &apos;s acting vice governor , thought they have &quot; little chance of survival . &quot;
such a high death toll even in the early phase of the flood season that lasts from june to september this year has caused people to worry that more people may die in floods this year than in the floods of 1998 that drowned over 4,000 people .
statistics from the ministry of civil affairs indicate that up till now , 57 million people have been affected by the floods ; 800,000 buildings and houses have collapsed ; and more than 2 million hectares of farm land have been inundated .
the ministry disclosed that the floods have devastated a vast area of the country , from shaanxi province in the northwest , through sichuan province and chongqing in the southwest , to fujian province and jiangxi province in the southeast .
a staff member named liu , who works for china foundation for poverty alleviation , said today that although the current death toll by floods is smaller than that of 1998 , the affected area is much larger than in 1998 . in that year , 10 provinces and cities were ravaged by floods , but 19 provinces and cities are hit this year .
he pointed out that another characteristic of this year &apos;s floods is that many affected people are extremely poor and have almost no means to sustain their losses .
liu said : &quot; the poverty-stricken areas are especially hit hard in the first phase of the floods this year . many of those counties and cities are listed as the poorest in the country .
some of the disaster areas are rendered inaccessible as roads have been broken by floods . many people have become homeless ; and still many other flood victims are waiting for food and other relief items . &quot;
umno announces mahathir will step down next year ; abdullah to succeed him
( afp , kuala lumpur ) malaysia &apos;s ruling party umno announced that prime minister mahathir will step down next year and hand over his office to his deputy abdullah .
umno secretary general yaakob said that mahathir , who has stayed in power for 21 years , will resign after the summit of the organization of islamic conference to be held here in october next year .
yaakob said mahathir &quot; has decided to resign from all his positions at umno , barisan nasional coalition and the government . &quot;
on the 22nd , at the conclusion of the umno annual congress , mahathir announced in tears his resignation from umno and his presidency of the ruling nasional coalition to a stunned malaysia .
when the entire country of malaysia was watching the live televised announcement of his resignation , mahathir was quickly hustled off the chairman &apos;s podium by stunned umno party leaders into a secluded room . when abdullah returned to the conference hall , he said mahathir has agreed to stay in office .
however , mahathir himself didn &apos;t offer any further public explanation and went on a vacation trip to italy the next day after throwing the whole country into a political turmoil .
beneath the huge portrait of mahathir and in the company of abdullah and other umno leaders , yaakob read at umno headquarters the statement clarifying mahathir &apos;s future .
he said that mahathir will take two months of vacation prior to his final resignation so as to facilitate a smooth transfer of power to abdullah .
after this announcement , abdullah , who serves both as vice prime minister and the vice president of umno , said in this live televised press conference : &quot; ( nasional coalition ) superior council supports 100 % ( mahathir &apos;s ) this decision . &quot;
abdullah said : &quot; there will be a smooth transfer of power during the entire process , but at present , he is still the prime minister . &quot;

us appellate court rules pledge of allegiance unconstitutional
( afp , san francisco , june 27 ) a us appellate court ruled that the pledge of allegiance that us pupils are required to recite every day before classes start is unconstitutional because it uses the name of god .
the shocking ruling made by the three judges in san francisco is bound to set off strong repercussions from the us public .
the relation between the church and the state has long been a topic of major controversy in the united states .
the judges in the 9th us circuit court of appeals pointed out in the written ruling that the sentence containing &quot; one nation , under god &quot; in the pledge of allegiance demonstrates the government &apos;s support of religious intervention forbidden by the us constitution .
an atheist filed the lawsuit with the circuit court of appeals in san francisco in protest that his daughter has to recite the pledge of allegiance every morning in school .
his appeal case was accepted .
citing a us supreme court judgement , judge goodwin noted in the ruling that schools are not allowed to hold religious prayers at the graduation ceremonies nor can students be compelled to recite the pledge of allegiance .
millions of us pupils aged from 5 to 11 must put their right hands across their chests and recite the pledge of allegiance in front of the us national flag every morning before classes start .
the controversial phrase &quot; under god &quot; was added to the pledge of allegiance in 1954 when eisenhower was in office .
the pledger must pledge allegiance to &quot; the flag of the united states of america , and to the republic for which it stands , one nation under god , with liberty and justice indivisible . &quot;
in the united states , the separation of church and state has always been an issue of controversy . the ban of morning prayers by state schools has already caused strong repercussions in this nation known for its devout religious belief and patriotism .
the ruling , once effective , will impact public schools in the 8 western states , the us guam and northern mariana islands .
the case for sure will go to the us supreme court .

president bush said : &quot; corporate america must understand that apart from making false accounting statements , inflating business revenue and hoping nobody ever knows , there is a higher calling out there , that is , you are responsible for this country . &quot;
prior to president bush &apos;s above remark , scandals of accounting fraud , inside trading and other malfeasance broke out in a number of us businesses , one of the most recent being xerox corporation &apos;s overstatement of business revenue .

the un command headed by the united states once called for a general-level conference of unc armistice committee , pointing out that north korea has already violated the armistice between the two koreas .
yonhap reported that north korea rejected the proposal , pointing out that the northern limit line ( nll ) , the unofficial maritime border between the two koreas , must be first annulled .

after navy vessels of south and north koreas had a fierce gunbattle in the yellow sea in which 4 south korean soldiers were killed , 1 was missing and 22 were injured , tensions remain high at the cold war front .

the nobel peace prize winner said : &quot; the government will take necessary measures so that the people can engage in their work without concerns . &quot;
kim dae-jung will keep in touch with defense minister kim dong-shin via hotline during his 3-day stay in japan .
the naval clash between south and north koreas has escalated tensions between the two sides , making their relationship plunge to the lowest point since kim dae-jung and north korean leader kim jong-il held the historic summit meeting two years ago .
the 20-minute sea battle between south and north koreas took place at a time when the world cup soccer tournament is drawing to a close in south korea and japan .
south korea has demanded an apology from north korea , believing the clash must have been provoked by the north korean military .
however , north korea instead accused south korea of firing the first shot .
us cassini spacecraft runs well on mission to study saturn
xinhua news agency , los angeles , may 21 ( reporter zhang xiaojun ) a recent news release from nasa said that the cassini spacecraft on mission to study saturn is currently running well and approaching the planned orbit around saturn .
program manager robert mitchell at nasa &apos;s jet propulsion laboratory said that for months the lens of the camera carried on cassini had been frosted with a thin haze , which affected the quality of its picture-taking .
using a built-in heater in the camera , scientists conducted a 60-day warming treatment . the most recent photos sent back to earth show that the problem has already been fixed .
as of now , cassini has sent back a large number of photos of important research value .
in december 2000 , when cassini flew over jupiter , the spacecraft &apos;s narrow-angle camera took accurate pictures of jupiter .
weighing 5.67 tons , the cassini spacecraft was launched into sky on october 15 , 1997 from cape canaveral in florida , beginning its 7-year-long , 3.5 billion-kilometer trip to saturn .
under the force of gravity , the &quot; cassini &quot; spacecraft flew by venus twice , brushed past earth by 900 km in august 1999 , and then flew by jupiter . it is scheduled to enter the orbit around saturn in july 2004 to start a 4-year exploration of saturn &apos;s mysterious ring system and its moons .
the probe &quot; huygens &quot; carried on the &quot; cassini &quot; spacecraft will land on the surface of saturn &apos;s satellite titan , the largest of all saturn &apos;s moons .
scientists have long conjectured that oceans of liquid methane exist on titan .

xinhua news agency , kathmandu , may 22 ( reporter song dejun ) the press secretariat of nepal &apos;s royal palace issued a news release on the night of the 22nd that based on the recommendation by prime minister deuba of the royal government of nepal , king gyanendra has announced the immediate dissolution of the nepali parliament .
at the same time , king gyanendra also announced that the current government headed by deuba will continue to stay in power until november 13 this year when a new administration is established through the national election .
deuba proposed earlier to extend by six months the national state of emergency which expires on the 25th of this month so that nepal &apos;s government army can launch a nationwide crackdown on the anti-government armed forces and eventually wipe them out .
however , under nepal &apos;s constitution , deuba &apos;s proposal needs to be approved by more than two-thirds of the parliament members before it can be implemented .
it was originally scheduled that the nepali parliament convenes on the 23rd to discuss deuba &apos;s proposal .
however , the ruling congress party as well as other parties have continuously held meetings in recent days , unanimously opposing the extension of the state of emergency .
in the meantime , they also indicated that they will openly oppose this government &apos;s decision at the meeting to be held on the 23rd .
therefore , deuba proposed to the king to dissolve the parliament .
housing price hikes accelerating in britain
xinhua news agency , london , may 22 ( reporter liu guishan ) according to the news released on the 22nd by a monitoring institution that monitors over 4,000 real estate agents in england and wales , the housing prices in britain have been increasing at the fastest speed in two years , making people concerned that a crisis may be imminent in the real estate market that has been hot for over a year .
the survey by the institution shows that in the first four months of this year , the real estate price in britain rose by 7.7 % . april alone saw an increase of 2.6 % .
the survey by the british nationwide building society , moreover , shows the increase in the housing price in april reached 3.4 % .
the monitoring institution thinks that at present , the inventory of houses has dropped to the lowest point in the past 23 years while the numbers of rental property buyers and first-time buyers have been growing , indicating a housing bubble is in the making in the british real estate market .
given the current economic situation , it is likely that britain will raise the interest rate this year and next year . if the interest rate is up 2 percentage points , the real estate bubble will burst .
the real estate market in britain has been very hot since last year when the annual rate of increase in housing prices exceeded 10 % .
the dwindling inventory of houses , the dramatic interest rate cut , and high employment rate all contributed to this situation .
analysts are concerned that since there is no sign yet of any slowing down of this price hike , the prospect of the british real estate market as where it is heading now is far from optimistic .

the three residential buildings being reinforced were all built in the 1930s and have a total of 72 households .
before the reinforcement , 70 % of the exterior layer has already peeled off .
a six-storied building located on waxili baowen blvd. was built in 1930 and suffered partial structural damage in the 1977 earthquake . however , the unique architectural style of this building has maintained its peculiar charm and never failed to draw the admiration of passers-by .

eu to take retaliatory measures against us over steel trade dispute
xinhua news agency , brussels , june 18 ( reporter tian fan ) the european commission announced on the 18th that it may take retaliatory measures against the united states over the eu-us steel trade dispute and has already officially notified the wto of the issue .
the european commission spokesman gooch said at a press conference that after the european commission has officially notified the wto , &quot; the eu can feel free to impose retaliatory tariffs on us products . &quot;
he noted at the same time that the eu &apos;s final decision on sanctions will be made after the european commission informs governments of the eu member nations of its negotiations with the united states on july 18 .
according to the relevant regulations , if the eu wants to impose retaliatory tariffs on us products , it must officially notify the wto of its sanctions by the 18th of this month .
the us government announced in march this year that it would impose tariffs as high as 30 % on steel product imports . this has caused the resentment of many steel exporting nations , among whom the much-affected eu reacted most strongly .
the eu wanted the united states to repeal the high tariffs on steel imports or take trade compensatory measures .
at the same time it is bringing this lawsuit to the wto , the eu has also drawn up a list of imports from the united states such as fruit juice and textiles upon which it plans to impose retaliatory tariffs .
early this month , the wto appointed a special panel to investigate the us-eu steel trade dispute .
on the 7th of this month , the us government announced 61 types of steel imports exempt from high tariffs and said it will announce additional lists of products exempt from high tariffs later on .
meanwhile , analysts pointed out that the reason for the eu &apos;s notification of the wto of its trade retaliatory measures is to put more pressure on the us government and force the united states into making more concessions in the eu-us steel trade dispute .
