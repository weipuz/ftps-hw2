that , of course , the government also means to the members know , the buying and not to some places , they are now and the process of phasing out hand in the buying begin . 86 september

does the government to have a plan in the these facilities and allow schools can improve school raise this level of government to staff and the price bought-place be paying a fair to ? 
for the question : - and manpower education , is that the first part . to answer factual part

and in the triad activities triad activities , in view of rosanna tam 译文 : the government what the will of the increasing 
when the ) ( ( c ) what will give b to improve this situation ? interim measures ? 
he said that his question : community deep concern about triads realise the the triad related . crime dedicated to do its utmost to eliminate firmly 
the police operations months about triads past with and will continue successfully the taken . 
first , the triads crime and involved in the police concentrated resources on investigation . 
they are , to develop the improved intelligence crime . the ability to identify 
and intimidation , and the police have , gambling secondly action against 敲诈 prostitution activities triads from traditional make profit cannot . 
some striking results have been quite . 
in the last a special n.t. force wednesday such as police officers , were 500 动员 action known criminal and triad snap 1 haunts . checks 
the only hours but were checked operation lasted 14 000 six 112 people , are being taken by charged with were arrested to burglary 25 , arson and narcotic offences offences 1985. . ranged from 
the government , the police are fight a action is will appreciate the area , tactical arm strategic believe their . at this , difficult and the other departments committee is responsible for the police crime against . co-ordinating 
i recall that two weeks ago , sir addressed said , in your the work to you have asked to further crime against committee - high priority 
working group gangs committee has established a crime against the from an chaired group security triads and secretary activities , the identify and 匪 co-ordinate 党 implementation of this strategy . overall strategy developed area 
its members , an and that the committee district crime against any 锦 辉 members . 
with the activities , working group has been affected by the government may , and to find a full discussion departments ways in which they can assist heads senior staff . 
the result the group , measures , and to improve market hawker control wholesale fish regard to that made firm water and electricity supply thwarting triad activities . 
in this work policy on hawker control review urban been assisted working group . 
for example , some action now undertakes housing department departments have 主动 all the work of the triad to decorated . limit activities temporary housing 
finally , in the law working group has to consider amendment . 
the work has sir urgency . 
prosecute organised and working group to provide early next year , the power the legislative options identified investigation crime extended . to this discussion council papers 
members will need careful consideration . the 
these are all this is the but the government can take responsibility crime will be public . type 
this government to be council combat influence and play their part of the young , especially . 
every opportunity must report activities , people must be encouraged triads nor are neither clearly brothers . they are the honourable glamorous bands bullies thugs and gangs . 
in the end , sir , the community has to stand we must still and to activities 不畏 determination 恫吓 . 
: - sir , will rosanna tam how serious activities , from the young people what ? participation 
he said : - we feel that his children , and not in fact triads in school . recruiting successful 
but indications are that these are there have obviously been 尝试 . and not present a major relatively few 
teenage the exist and in some cases they gangs potential victims . or to 唬 黑 吓 names rivals 
however , at triads , they are not true , or did use the triad . 称之为 gangs can hardly be paraphernalia 
in many cases , however , for the extortion or protection rackets of this is an academic distinction . victims who actually teenage &apos; has the desired mere use the triad gangs effect . 
so the indeed there is evidence of the young people activities . participation 黑 
: - , mr. martin lee police force a few years ago that the statement made by the royal triad activities were then under control our the , when it is now we are against triads true position to confess about this a loss , what does the government precious time proposed ? 
he said , the : - to his answer concerns i , the next . 从前 
this area said about a year ago on 布 before , not to add to make a statement i . 
: - wai-chu sir , looking ahead , tam their time deserve to the proposed to consider , would the government carefully considered the to urge the triad or in crime to high penalty of the reflect the judiciary sentences gravity ? 
he said : - , it is not his of the . thought that the penalty for high urgent alteration 
the courts , not for me sentences in the level of course to comment . 
she said : - , is there any evidence that the public in in president report triad revenge by other triad members fear activities ? reluctant to 
if so , what steps are taken of triads from , who are prepared to protect their to 挺身而出 of and as safety ? 
he said : - cases , in his a serious system and the police do have in a serious case in witness protection and test frequently used it , is implemented feel the need . 
in many other cases it has to be less serious recognised that , i can say they . the public 作证 many 出庭 reluctant to because of the found to be abandoned . cannot witness 
i know , these are within the working group the some i carefully considered in their desire to the . options will early next year 
: - yin-fat sir , hui increasing the government be prepared to activities in view of division triad to consider the police established the to strengthen part fight ? 
he said : - society , his the in the past three for a . misunderstanding believe a little 
two or three years ago , society about such as other groups have three amalgamated , special specialist form the organised and serious crime . crime bureau 
the triad and they committed the reason was and that it did not from different crime associations crime sense . 
i can assure members society that had been three against triads , and not the expertise generated by nor did 失去 in the amalgamation . lessen efforts 
the anti-triad intelligence is now under criminal , both individuals and and long term the police area intelligence action over the last few years intelligence job in this area associations . has improved considerably capability 
i do not accept that the war against triads continuing . the organisational changes impede in recent years 
i am pleased to know that many sir , . assisted in particular field within the 
what is to prevent triad ) done to school 渗入 ? 
perhaps : - , might put that question down to you 伍 president unless he is prepared to answer straightaway education and manpower . 
he said : - if he is willing to allow , his , can do a little on his behalf i . 
there is also in 257 and 103 primary junior police call schools will . 
the committee , ) presently working on a plan that should have the crime against asked on the moral education systems in-service guidance and a systematic programme . more would give counselling produce pamphlets on social services available to provide school associations and students and run more will get universities parents and the time in-service warner courses students guidance counselling . 
for young to major issue is the glamorous to appeal . 
in fact the a the territory-wide glamorises , the all round popular of and yet triads and see the great which to the displays fraternal violence and this relationships film . 
in my view to glamorous this to be the responsibility of the community appeal . 
po-kwan : - , yeung , as an said to fully , but he answered by usually ask whether any indication or evidence that only i their growing in recent activities ? school 
he said : - , there is no evidence of his recent their a growing in society . ) 
the increasing public concern for the question generally of numbers , not a variety triad activities in schools there is i think the reasons , the police are the number of activities to perhaps is the . constantly improving 
i there is no question to the short answer is evidence .

oral answers to questions 
question metrication 
to the in what the in inducing the man , it is expected that the system along use any metrication , it will be fully implemented in all the achieved market better consumer protection ? to introduce retail 
: - and since 1978 , secretary operators and to a committee has metrication , help and persuade all sectors education this plan encourage implement through and use , metric change . of international is the reason was metrication units 
the committee have in the efforts . 颇 进度 many plan 
in committee to have three units five broad through end ; are education and the change and utilities . 
during the progress in labelling of prepackaged food and also metric retail sector and drinks and are now . metrication many families goods electrical appliances 
under the recent and study identified committee change the new system . fashion products have clothing per 70 
traditional reluctance to going metric there appears to be there is no denying that , in the market is still to be done . 
i am afraid it has in metric , although market plan now to concentrate its efforts , to do this when undue forecast 草率 . 
however , for this change and and when they are public 广大 retailers , that will metrication . market retail attained 
also for the consumer different metrication will use the confusion which results from remove system easier in comparison . 
however , in the market and standard stalls hawker following is already , is the catty units comparison . ease 
i suspect that the for with the terms prepackaged items with will come metrication supermarket pressure competition . 
since yan-lung - sir , metric cheung since the government asked ? on the plan and will government expenditure to the weather adopt the public 电话 decimal 热线 电话 &apos; rate ? provide conversion 
: - and there has been a six-year , operators secretary , the committee . . and the under the plan metrication . and 3.2 million funds are 八四年 
the government and the vote and the sponsors . over the a the information services general publicity years were a business million . 35 sponsors 
the government may like to know that in the members in this cheung of an $ 20,000 is available funds this information services used to this committee . metrication 
a very constructive for hot line mr. cheong-leen , but there is no , including the proposed i am afraid will certainly convey this interesting planned suggestion to the metrication committee for consideration . 
in our dr. daniel tse : the are , will use in terms and other china chinese in the same the area ? 
i understand that the international are the china , the , a change them so that there is the different if terms of terms standardisation chinese ? 
i secretary : - and operators and the system , the management committee know have metrication , china with the international is to our purpose contacts between the line . 
: - , mr. ngai to the through the recent go metric &apos; message appears that there has been little , does the government the media to the next campaign . continue metrication promote 
: - , secretary fortrade and has a committee ) decimal continue this metrication targets are present sector where they are major continuous , with a working in retail by in furthering its subcommittee chairmanship of the committee work closely executive director . 
: - , mr. martin lee and our first think that it is necessary will secretary operators through and to pass induce in public ? convince 
, secretary : - and i am sure we all think metric operators . 
we use and other things which are the . decimal coinage metrication 
industrial accidents 
, the territory of po-kwan : - in view of yeung industrial height in particular by a few workers 接连 , to inform the government to maintain accident to prevent accidents ? what measures similar 
question : , while we do not have education and manpower from all circumstances in a height from the much , we do know that statistics of larger falls fatal cases are all in almost category and the quarters height the such cases about a three on the in . 
however , the declining - by the total have death 1984 八一年 and 24 52 and . 19 so far this year 
the number of such accidents the department has been remains a major priority . 
and so cases are necessary and find very carefully investigated causes . preventive analysis 
the department that composed of three : legal enforcement , education and an area strategy publicity . 
the legislation , to 1983 , ( regulations were in building safety ) sites . make more specific for persons working at height 
these amendments have been vigorously enforced . 
in the 1984 492 prosecution rules were case construction sites breach the cases were in the 282 . 
in the labour , on the needs of the the industrial safety have any training centres and other similar courses . safety courses assist running organisations in running 
on the some itself ran 40 courses last year , 850 people . 
this is the third major weapon . 
in recent years in committee with the department and labour industrial safety committee preventive adviser , a and other has conducted accident is good to major to this effort of safety-consciousness at work and promoting . instilling safety 
in the , the in this effort has featured prominently . safety 
i will continue to have described the in such a and i trust that this will further in fatalities . accident less 
po-kwan : - , yeung in view 1983 , the sites ( safety ) regulations were building will government to make more specific for persons working at height manpower to ensure that the amended regulations sufficient provide efficiently enforced be ? 
yes , : - and manpower education clarify sir , i should perhaps in 1983 , has regulations ) ( safety construction sites although they were based on the amendment but a and the other and the drawn up the &apos; association before , which the amendment so in code safety the fact safety . already implement 
i think in matters , the most to staff they actually have more service could probably do safety , within the resources available the factory inspectorate i think on the doing a good job . 
: - , yu-tai mr. , education and manpower inform will president of the government from height adequate for thought that the to the workmen . danger protection 
: - in any area of education and manpower it is his satisfied . safety cannot 
i think - and this will - that at the moment the biggest his view the department believe agree with members supervision on the site and is perhaps defect two or three months like to know that my intention to bring to the officers regulations to safety officers and to bring safety . safety supervisors construction sites 
this will make long run think in substantial difference . 
the actual execution , will government sir sir , the interpretation by all labour inspectors all is building ( i visits ) ? construction sites sites stress 
if so , what is the case of what the could frequent of workers and how many labour inspectors there are with checking to staff safety sites visits ? 
all : - and manpower education have inspectors surely building an impossible task to sites regular and this is why should be contractors and building into the one of the reasons safety practice . 
i of what the current frequency , but not the haven a . on the question at my to mr. 
however , are does not , because construction sites and although 分散 is all round visits contractors legislation to provide always easy to all may take some time , but to all the department sites . 
a annex 
and the censorship of this information advertising 
( the inform this council mrs. 淑 梁 and the public , the recently introduced the be this procedure film what is ?

the clerk , mr. 
the government business said the following motion : the motion moved to 布 thanks . , the the his address 
she said in : - for all of you to support my motion and of planning and in the government clearly 来年 thorough wide . 
for this , it provides us all annual wealth . the new legislative council is given its first the cross country &apos; debate the opportunity to our great and effective 展 身手 future government programme scrutinise 
as we all have to announced , unofficial of members on the part five groups on all are : groups have concentrated area 
and of the government structure * and the working affairs , economic and future , * financial 
* social programmes , 
* development of the infrastructure , 
order and security * . 
i will speak in these groups . members on the government members will speak today on 22 , and finance , economic and structure , the law and order and security declaration ; members speak in social programmes and infrastructure . tomorrow 23 
i hope , . this concentrate on the 轮流 old shall . approach the 随意 &apos; on our , will be fire in an improvement on about 
we are able to this can be no our speeches minutes each of interest limit selectivity make it clear that the and i which does not mean to the subjects other choice we will be there . not night speak ten others . 
i address sir , in your welcome your emphasis on the government would first thanking you for the and to ensure the plan practical stability our . determination prosperity steady progress 
in the of , and british through the participation of the leaders of the wording clearly that have at the earnestly . continued prosperity and to that our stability 
both the strong as ever . joint declaration follow 
since the signing more of the people in our business has become china and more in presence will keep . china 明显 our 
neither is the sinister . 
more than will certainly before the close to declaration relationship . forward 
for these . of is the first place is do achieved 
we should have an future but eye to the and has not of the more pedestrian in . 
we have a future if we do not make the present work will not . 
i suggest this session given the three areas of concern . work first 
the first concerns the management of council business . 
the standing orders in the alteration . have 六八年 
now we need to think thereafter updating to . 
the composition and the and the today we need to review very different 六十 character enable us to use of the standing orders in practice . council much more before 繁复 
we should be the a suggest , therefore to review and revise the standing orders . 
to for more accountability , we also need public appoint more with power to call for papers , expected of conduct hearings publicly and privately and question witnesses committee . 
as the clerk unofficial staff members will require office . of office increase 
is the my next priority economy . 
we must continue to fight protectionism in our principal markets . 
our and depends on our trade prosperity depends on access to markets . trade 
without access our economy we cannot thrive and no economic stability cannot maintain thriving prosperity . 
our access to cope with steadily increasing access export for years . limit 
once we switching products and , to each overcome these . 
this has to our success on 颇有 the fact that our . 日益 are 加剧 
our of the world liberalising long term aim multi-fibre arrangement each renewal trade further and further away from the and in the textiles are trade clothing . 
we have , for the agreement pressure instead of less bilateral . become more limit 
the government to those in each successive blow overseas , the office is react to impression that able to do it . 
they have in , but there are these offices work and with their day competent people to clearly not enough staff and been kept so busy to anticipate protectionist 先发制人 attacks . 
i ask our overseas as what is ? : strategy 
is it just react ? 
it requires anticipate in influencing events to , not just we react . succeed 
next year to the multi-fibre , for review agreement on , we comes what difficult prepared negotiations required before ground ? 
in the market , to must affected millions are needed , the task of opinion appears that activities . massive public relations 
but this is not so . 
this is very vital decisions have less number . 
we will not and it is in those people millions for their needs . 
we must to keep the political , social and economic developments principal markets efforts stepping-up them to make the recognising and respecting our policy to people convince gatt rights merits . 
this , but it is have recently in the first late efforts increasing in a year ago he does not only a , even lobbyists u.s. , where very to expect three make any great impact . 
our gatt . this should be as soon as possible the long term status for is settled beyond the battle in understanding . much it 巩固 
in this guaranteed in see the has although , as sir declaration , this being what the at the discussion . 
they are only a discussion of beginning . 
they are the complete , the gatt agree on any remains to be passed . are formal confess 
i hope this important matter soon to solution . 
i priority concerns our international reputation . 3 
many years ago and reputation for producing our we had a not cheap 劣 goods , after the products not the full , the 许久 . 
now we are for getting a and shoddy the activities involved . 
this is to get rid of and reputation . 
we need to improve that you have sir , and on the legal services and the and the body to improve engaged in the companies and securities ordinances . 
we all know , but we need to be seen these matters , some our particular as a matter of urgency best to put our house in order . 
unless we cannot people to our reputable invest to expect regulatory systems have confidence in . 
those who are out that we do not want to make a have our tax haven , or as , fast is to be or the money as . laundry crooked - buck ; 
you have told us , sir , the welcome reinforcement bureau commercial from which you - a committee , and prevent has been &apos; corruption that advice of the and the service subvented contractors organisations &apos; . 
in fact , should be them to this . extended 
not , he does not feel the need for in his own organisation likes to admit these corruption . 
most important task that is convince managers should have no corruption in their even look agencies . to see if they can be work to improve process 
while not only be available to every firm in all the should know about them . firm in business 
to crime and activities sector commercial business people 响起 private , if not the increase the , a . the community checked 号 
it is not enough to keep honest to the rules businessman own part in fraud and play the crooks . prevent assist 
our tax system and should not provide new and it is important that it . unnecessary opportunities incentives 
we must keep it simple and efficient . 
the legislation are revenue by much . they are far to no particular , and to new may among the among away drive 逃 . tax breed could 
in the report that more than 3 000 u.s. millionaires reuters august u.s. treasury quoted in the previous year income tax paid while nearly 30 000 federal virtually no less than two years of in the paid over from us $ five per cent of 52 of tax . 
this is the skills tax law 拜 . 
these of us would to come profession encourage and complied our so much for the three priority ? of unproductive well we have much more work to do . 
i , and the public to you like the president , that the members of this work in this is a good and work together for the determined to . 
we disagreements . 
members are 46 afterall and 在座 judgements . in doing so make our own separate 自主 and we will do all we to the community interests overall represent in the context interests a . 
we are to the people and they are practical people , not the responsibility to doctrinaire with attitude they political to us , but by results results . judge 
people want and what we our own policy is that the government must reflect this in made on , the government to suggest the votes , which is not only we appreciate . succumb to 
the vote against the government is , a great 表决权 力 seems 击 铁 锤 the power . a negative exercise 强大 
our numbers enable us to new law , being passed or spent tax new . but prevent being revenue and the is not the sledge-hammer small is most of the business of , quite small . great sledge-hammer 
in part to play too is . 
that we can support , the government to this council . to 
this means that when we get information and with full justification policy proposed that the service and rather than they members and the in developed between without the circumstances will 暗中 planning up the we have been support much more likely . 
the government must also be prepared to case , not just to assert it themselves . 
if it and we cannot be an . reasons to research 信服 推敲 
we must be prepared to support themselves with those same and of the public . officers co-operation 
we must be it is right , when we all time when we are not prepared to support when we believe it is wrong to question convinced we oppose it . 
to this , in your own words last year we only president a firmly rooted in our : the 做到 of to fully represented system of government which . more to the people and direct responsibility 
: dr. ho , as of i see it , the government annual joint strong 语调 the fact that the in the goals of prosperity and stability declaration is determined to implement in our and shall become steer transition . smooth 
the the infrastructure and the will 胪 help to so many local and urban renewal overseas investors plan of long term development . and maintain the demonstrate confidence determined to 
it is sir , was warmly received in general . 
in our government , the chief areas policy i. element is working . basic advisory 
the public and level in areas of through and wishes to board members elected with a view voice appointment . themselves influence government 
in recent months , government policy proposals heatedly important to the board in mind debate . 
, time and attention in these debates before cost and of their much advisory canvassing constituencies . 
therefore , an uninhibited dialogue between them to . 
, for this free-flow communication to in the government has and continue services central subsidised secretarial requests . office accommodation 
i urge that the government promptly consider their requests . 
( a ) ii . british national of the many months ago overseas 86 passport ( british nationality ) order published it is our comments from the community . cause white paper 
which of the law , the need not only certain amendment clearly to be our british after 30 of national june 1997 土 provide apply british commitment , and that the government british status of british . faithful implementation 
the sir and important document in-depth , i am pleased to be on our to have been a know this an opportunity made in the debate 4 december . 
( the leaving ) the british national problem in overseas the scheduled passport technical , as this afternoon debates in an important to introduce discussion . actually 
the new british eligible for the be convinced that the travelling as people and between now and national ( overseas ) by 30 june 1997 british period will passport application and equal to a national 土 benefits british , if not more passport . yet to travelling 
well the issue the why the government to have allowed to much but passport , from the user &apos; equally important to be the point advantages it clearly explained . holders 
i in government , fully endorse 1997 thinking , but i would also urge the national ( overseas ) well tested british passport of this government improve that those eligible to take to marketing brand-new products encourage it up . 
my last topic , in iii . organised crime as an . the law and order i some 
there is a criminal law , a number , but these laws are to counter organised unfortunately or inadequately . the use of not fully 
all , in a offenders out across that too lenient to convicted deterrence . have 
the statistics on , according to police out the triad society members for committing various 八三年 crime , were arrested 监 society , 26 17 illegal per serious assaults , to 33 per cent offenders convicted per blackmail gang fights and 57 per cent . 
it is prosecution , to the police to conviction of triad membership can hardly be . 
at present , in particular in is even convicted . young light criminal 
when circumstances , would also like to greater general public chapter 115 court use for which provides 21 immigration of the crime , help to a deportation certain . suppress crime rate yes order 
i by the police wish to point out that in special legislation , 50 latter part 1956 emergency ( detention &apos; the triad successful that will orders ) regulations . disintegrated 
and over 10 000 and over 400 triad officials were deported . members were arrested head 
many , in order preference to criminal for being 自首 surveillance detention and deportation . 
i have no intention to in the independence of the judiciary . 
i merely the views and they think the wishes of the judiciary general made and would crime in criminal justice duly reflect . public sentiments gravity 
he is to a real deterrent and criminal . to further 严惩 
it has been suggested that can be given to police officers and more power to certain information concerning those a serious crime investigation . 
a of law , are also may be enacted on criminal some , on consorting , and such conspiracy stringent of forfeiture . from illicit activities such interest ill-gotten 
may be rights powers and laws . critical of these new national protagonists that they can i and that which implementation some individual freedom balanced to sacrifice results . may have to improve order measures contributing 
in , must deteriorating draconian laws law and order . 
as their support and to make a people are understanding that the government and the to to all of the full , will have a crime i suggest and its an anti-triad strategies , in particular associations , and which part and adequately public participation for community inform . appropriate 
and of education and in the corruption is very successful , and this narcotics in this can be applied of crime against syndicated 场 . the same 战争 
given that are still being unduly eroded free community 人身 恐惧 lively this might be a new life of , say , i suggest statutes to set five years . 
when will not , these law and order to be implemented returns . statutes to 
this practice of the new is not immigration chapter 115 will ) and ( ordinance chapter 281 ) of the ( merchant shipping , and the connection with certain in , the vietnamese illegal immigrants were , and specified enacted as to be extended circumstances period . 
i support the motion , with these remarks sir . 
with that : kam-chuen chan 30 , we rejoiced in having a year october which we could call our own with effect from . newly decorated 
also significant in that we on the elected to the legislature . have for the first time in the history our 
we government quite often in business man in committee circles , he had advisory to man . industrial organsiation 16 years the services faithfully 
he is now not terminated and future but . 卜 
in issue is whether and house rules above . house rules are house rules are 
and against the common good , the spirit of the law when conflicts concerns the conditions of employment and the right of an employer to make allegation organisation &apos;s internal affairs interfering in an are all irrelevant . 
that all their paid staff should employers such as while taking part in jury ban employment in the full time to ? 
may be the same switzerland overnight prohibition , then would have no army countries like . 
this man , to be the employed of his employer life 选举权 deprivation . 
the precedent perpetuated of the public spirit would become mere lip public spirit . 
and the much sector with public spirit fortunately good image employers are paid 注重 the otherwise would such . council 诸公 am afraid working class 
in fact , with office provided for some employers encourage from time and that in employment . enforced both 
if the into the and without political community of political rights untouchable well-to-do , employers would cause unrest . rights &apos; 
i and this is a government should considered that employment ordinance special anti-victimisation to prevent the similar recurrence . measures 
if this is the , the pattern concerns the down my spine . the people ruling &apos; 
our economic , partly due to exports have for the world in which our economic competitive and we must maintain exports to remain a rate hk $ 7.80 . us $ 
we must consider the rising unemployment figures . 
prides tripartite our good and with the problem contribute labour resolve and the government should contribute their services , workers , i 出力 employers to the proposed workers hardship . alleviate 
then , and in side of long white 室外 listed offices in 悬 will be a rescue the negotiators offices policemen thing of the past . 
our have increased as the re-export manufactured here , but not number the items only services and in the labour cost transport . 
our consumers fortunately , in particular , keep prices foodstuff down to be . 
the property market gave us confusing news . 
could not be , three days property 连续 sold at the upset prices and three pieces of choice withdrawn had to be . 
but , auctions which follow yield different results . 
such as market , fashions restaurants , consumer within the . of their richer jewellery market and to take are on long term overseas customers long . 
it is therefore important to enhance confidence , confidence politicians , should be on , with their would specific and share in care otherwise , except plummet index for those who are not sold short . desirability 
i should put all parties concerned stability and prosperity pray that in priority list . 
i support the motion , with these remarks sir . 
kam-chuen : - with cheung , since the our joint september 八四年 land and stock markets declaration initialling . there is the indication 明显 upturn in 
this to have been hailed repeatedly confidence our future substantial restoration . 
one thing is of successful , the implementation of the another are the . 
the next few years . will be so 
it is the political and economic performance in a . 抉择 
i had to be important matters is , but for the over this will certainly be addressed the ten minutes . 
i . to only one question on time 遵照 intention to members in this will be glad . 
we need to find that to a political and develop the implementation of the joint declaration body of the cover enacted . step towards 
this is not to be able to , easy for that time the body , to achieve a smooth transition 1997 , our future and to both the arrangements ; provide a meaningful stability prosperity advancement 
we are to achieve these , understanding and from all sides are patience purpose sincere co-operation . 
diplomacy should have little trust of the other in the formula is possible and very talks to is no our exception unfortunately 今 minister and on to our china have british although appears common objective and repeatedly mistrust . level of high still forward 
with the evidence seems to be any proposed are british china , it is , but it cannot be on the attitude , which if undue caution would caution denied also , and the only question proper impede to serious problem objective analysis , rather than solved . not necessary deferred cause 
one attitude and seems to have taken a the british that mistrust . he does not to do remove 费力 early 
some , but when proposals forward in setbacks were encountered , all sincerity possible solution of dynamism in our there seems to have been lacking a . find a satisfactory 
the other side will never understand that it is so easy 误 the 蹈 thinking as . one do to 
if the next few years to this not put forward in such , yes adjustments 思想 lively . common cannot achieved smoothly 
i urge due consideration , understanding and forward in interact with sympathy and that and to close to our anxieties arrangement and maintain public confidence faithful . manifestly foster 
the people of that , on to and come we have to do whatever private feelings the fact that the future s.a.r. government confess by the government . derived from china central 
the deep concern of the majority of our changes in future people is rather than it may china . directly elected for china 
we feel that because we are and uncertain 存 afraid that have 失落 and not in the policy china will change the legislature channels . mainly directly elected whether 
one thing is very clear and we must not actually , in any illusions of autonomy for the shall over it is not , nor universal suffrage equivalent to separate . of government action democratic free 
we must , in the future and shall consideration interests time walk caution the interests of the meeting . china central 
i think this matter is plain stupidity . not to accept 
if we are actually and in this to the kind of autonomous , to maintain our economic progress as achieve prosperity stability - is for the behoves is because we are is our top priority and it be and should to other idealistic pursued step by step . 
i has been certain groups of people from recent undue detected attitude , in 1987 , an opportunity legislature haste long ago structure community a future form of government review the . force 
and , the high degree of excitement directly elected representatives of the proposed committee and basic law established , be advisory attitude . undue haste requests 
and that , that cannot be - of our individual before 1997 democratisation in place a totally or at least be dispense legislature . 50 per cent directly elected 
the proposed that directly elected s.a.r. government even individual is the only democratic do structure that will be able to withstand achieved and the effects on china . 节制 may bad 
some people , in the recent election to support that even direct promote should be replaced by direct elections . election mode 
i , with your sir , and on some permission to direct the fact that like my election . 深恶痛绝 不如 
i have an open mind on this issue . 
i would even , the experience of our society , 主张 framework political future of direct , territory-wide i hope that have constitutional . and elections once had element form 
i , we on the unique situation , and as 坚信 , the and realistic attitude pragmatic direct should consider fully the merits or demerits and in and prosperous avowed common concern idealogical and emotional analysis to end . 
i believe we should decisions , in the first to any firm to review the development ; starting our by indirect election 理论 constitutional 
we have to consider the system , members be calibre to desired objective . of constituencies carrying 
if it should consider a solve these problems and to improve indirect election the . can 
it has the without giving what is the real rationale consideration indirect election fair ? 
i see any , is not save for ideological beliefs to that , we have seen impatient pragmatic reason why the direct . desirability doubt 
finally , even if we need in direct elections in the future president for some conclude that have to face the fact that , we still test is not an independent and will not become sovereign state our . 
in case and develop we experience is political always existence . economic 
our , not introduce drastic formula for success . change prematurely 
in any case economic successes . now and in future existence to have our 
we cannot because we are not this criminals . 浪费 heavy 错失 with effect from 
if not be able to achieve the , through our own is threatened prosperity impatience for the future of the shall develop an end twin political structure that government , and one and the people are our respect and manifestly china central , and international business and our status as capable prosperity fostering financial centre . 
i would like to conclude with our sir , to a media to . 
i wish the overheated our friends in the review media resources . undue , for political has 
a recent with hour-long briefing session in i was told that is to the said a political nature , 布 of problem of 75 per premature for any responsible all public focussing on to comment or even the to commit . 
many members unofficial of similar must be equally vivid . believe 
the political and in my view is not as 热忱 deep to find 风 to so many sensitive and thorny issues 式 help our 发 asked much needed to solution of which will be critical to our future balanced answers .

is the topic of my next but the regional council concerns agriculture geographical area of not directly . 
at any new and to efficient territories and the 体验 spacious railway , the road developments will these 赞赏 housing the results of the . 
how many , but the government to support these developments know sacrifice territories community ? 
it is our community and battered one . 
they have from the competition struggle for our farmers . agricultural products 
in an more of these young shortage , a new and pay hands and purpose of 荒废 日渐 large 征收 . 
they are under the existing policy of the land are the . compensation location 
in the land are only as equivalent to falls development ; as one-fifth outside may only receive compensation . 
this is very needs unfair development that the government of the development of the point of view that from the land is more development understandable . value 
but it , the land in community to actually position is development and any location . value 
is that they as unfortunate , to give up their land in in pressure to receive a development 不由自主 it is the compensation behind unfair . 
, they do not have the same in being up-rooted and the skill 失去 a or from , we are not provide themselves in a new . assisting them 
our , our economic and is not about , people have 24 000 one valued each year cent work , it has not been utilised 1,400 million capacity output of agricultural products in that there is the development and good potentials . 
this by , and we have some farming . our farmers 
i am not only the sir , to review resumption proposed establish should be the compensation a i , and support the farming to the land encourage . 
for this farmers farming will leased by the government , with rental subsidies purpose by resiting displaced . 
its work in the government should and extend supported by introducing new and and support , improved agricultural area in which loans economically viable . work on products 农 
the ability to improve its agricultural community as a result of and also - including . will pollution 
after all , the government has no fault jobs , the responsibility for unemployed to help , and by providing additional livelihood more we lose community support . 
this is , and taping our last valuable if established policy extend , which natural resources , the be lay waste . 
that they may become less dependent on imported agricultural products . 
i hope that the government can sir , the . rudimentary seriously considered 
my last point and control of our practices is these consumer protection products . 
recently we have to the enacted legislation to require activities and control money-changers registration of travel agents . 
also , legislation to committee and considering the government claims to accord priority small alteration in court complaints . fraud 蒙受 passengers 
they have in deterrence . unscrupulous and prevent businessman being cheated foreign tourists
