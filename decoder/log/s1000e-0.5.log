what has happened here , last Tuesday , honourable Senate ? 
a selection committee was achievement . 
yesterday I attended a meeting of the first to committee . 
i am surprised that the committee and that it does not know what to do with the Senate rise independent too . 
i am not so that concern for the time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
over the next two years in the work that undertaking a senator . 
it is a committee , supposedly , as important to determine what these new Senate committee sit some senators . 
i am therefore introduced in the last sitting of the committee to realize that was one of the Senate of nine indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
i do not name , one honourable senators . 
i am therefore , that it cannot see you nice ? 
the Senate will have to find that had been because their own research . 
when one accepts an , it should do the job . 
the women who are sitting in the Senate have proven . 
they have much more that the majority of their remplissaient men in the Senate . 
i remember that some of those families to the committee held meetings in the February 1998 . 
here is the House of Commons or the Senate Ni at that time . 
the Liberals have three senators sat in the proceedings of all , women of the committee . 
the leadership of the Senate is to find a man was the committee . 
i could cite the words , words , to answer the question I asked senator Carstairs took him . 
i asked him Quels were the criteria are as follows : " ? " 
the minister said that it was the first to address the representation of women in a report . 
it was struck by the parliamentary associations in 1993 that . 
at the time of men were only formées Les delegations . 
on this issue , as I have been replaced by Senator Finestone for a number of years . 
however , I look forward to enter the my association has preferred . 
i do not know how , when the Senate honourable House or about these two reports will be decision . 
that is the senators on television whenever verdict . 
or , in a or any group of students from journalists wondered . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , it should be translated in fact . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
if a senator in a position accept a committee , he or she should participate in any provided meetings . 
we are not the members of the words in which the corridors : 
do you today and in committee , " Présentez after two years , we will vote in a committee to study final '' . 
they do not even know what they came to power , they are viewed stand to them when they stand . 
they do not know what happened no . 
the words " and " and " honourable senators is the way in our dedication continuité speech '' . 
over the next two weeks , the way we will look at the beginning to address independent senators . 
if we do not do that , I would be interested in the parliamentary committee on my own créerai world affairs . 
we try to no one can . 
the Honour the Speaker : 
if the hon. member wants to do any other senator , is it the pleasure to adopt the motion , you Senate and honourable ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
