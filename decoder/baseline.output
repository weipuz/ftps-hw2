what has happened here , last Tuesday , honourable Senate ? 
a bunch of was selection committee . 
yesterday I attended a meeting of the first to committee . 
i am surprised that the committee and that is what to do with the Senate rise independent knew too . 
i am not so that concern for the time . 
the selection committee can show some impact . 
the next two years in the debate on a Senate that undertaking . 
it is important to a committee , as to what they actually , supposedly new Senate committee sit some senators . 
i am therefore to note that the committee to report to the last sitting of the Senate of a new was indeed . 
it was sent a replacement . 
i do not name , one honourable senators . 
i am therefore , that it cannot see you nice ? 
that was in the Senate will have their own research in finding fault . 
it should do the job , when one accepts an . 
the sitting in the Senate women who have proven . 
they have the majority of the men in that much more remplissaient the Senate . 
i remember that the committee held to the of veterans of the meetings in February 1998 . 
the House of Commons are sitting in the Senate Ni or the time . 
the Liberals have sat in the Senate committee , three of the proceedings of all women . 
the leadership of the Senate committee to could not find it a man . 
i could cite the words , words , to answer the question I asked senator Carstairs took him . 
i asked him : " were the criteria are as follows " Quels ? 
the minister said that it was to address the first report of women in a representation . 
in 1993 that they were on the parliamentary associations drafted . 
at the time of men were only formées . The delegations 
i was in this regard , on a number of years in the Senate Finestone replaced . 
however , I look forward to enter the my association has preferred . 
i do not know how the Senate , or when honourable House about these two reports will be decision . 
is that each on television the verdict senators . 
in a or any group of students from journalists or wondered . 
if we do that ? 
it is true , I believe it . 
however , in fact it should be translated . 
i do not believe in the alternative . 
in a position to a committee ; a senator if we agree or any part of it should carry meetings . 
we are not in the members of the words which the corridors : 
do you today and in committee , " Présentez two years , there is a question and in committee to study final '' . 
they do not know what they are not even when it came to power , but their considers the their breakfast stand . 
they do not know what happened no . 
the words " and " and " honourable senators is the way in our dedication continuité speech '' . 
over the next two weeks , the way we will look at the beginning to address independent senators . 
i do not do that , if we as parliamentarians who are concerned about the my own créerai world affairs committee . 
we try to no one can . 
the Honour the Speaker : 
if you do not speak is it the pleasure , like other hon. Senator , to adopt the motion , honourable Senate ? 
some hon. members : 
in agreement . 
( motions deemed adopted , the report and agreed to )
