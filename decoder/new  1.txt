In the above example result:

 ----baseline-s1000-d10-k20.score------ 
Average corpus log probability (LM+TM): -1263.375212

Does this example use distortion penalty ? Or just use distortion limit in the search range?
We implemented the second (just use distortion limit) but only get -1314 with the same set of  parameters.
